Robert Peter Mugabe Jr's age is currently 30 years. The aspiring politician is popularly known as Tino, the shortened variation of his name Tinotenda, which means Thank God.</p><p class=align-left>The younger Mugabe is the first <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">surviving son </a>of his father. Robert Peter Mugabe Jr's siblings are three, if Michael Nhamodzenyika Mugabe, his father's first child who passed away three years after his birth, is not counted.</p><p class=align-left>Robert's surviving siblings include sister <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Bona Chikowore</a>, brother Chatunga Bellarmine, and stepbrother Russell Goreraza. All of them are doing good in their respective endeavours if their expensive lifestyle is anything to go by.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/400158d3906bf55c.jpg><h3>Robert Peter Mugabe Jr's education</h3><p class=align-left>Stizz, as he is popularly called, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">began his education</a> at the St. Michael's Presentation Primary School before switching to the Hartmann House Preparatory School. But then, after some time, his father decided to take him to study at the Kukuma mission, his father's alma mater.</p><p class=align-left>From there, Robert attended St. George's College and later St. John's College before studying for a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">degree in Architecture</a> at the <a href=#>University of Johannesburg</a>, South <a href=#>Africa</a>. His father once ridiculed him and <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">nicknamed him</a> The Undertaker because he got a lot of U grade scores in his A level examinations.</p><h2>Career</h2><p class=align-left>Nowadays, Robert Mugabe Jr's biography profiles him as an architect <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">planning to branch</a> into mainstream politics after his father's presidency was cut short in a coup; the man had been ruling the country for almost four decades.</p><p class=align-left>Since his father's death, Tino has become even more public with his dealings and associations. He told an interviewer that he wanted to be a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">professional basketball player</a> in the United States of America's National Basketball Association. Still, the situation with his family never gave him the freedom to pursue his choices.</p><p class=align-left>He, however, played a lot of basketball with the various age grades of the Zimbabwean national team. Robert has been <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">appearing in different conferences</a> organised by the ZANU-PF, the same party that his father belonged to during his regime as the President of Zimbabwe.</p><h2>Personal life</h2><p class=align-left>Robert keeps his relationship on a low level but recently shared the identity of his girlfriend with the media. The lucky lady is a model known as <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Hilary Makaya</a>.</p><h2>Robert Peter Mugabe Jr's net worth</h2><p class=align-left>Tinotenda's <a href=#>net worth</a> is unspecified, but it is public knowledge that he enjoys many <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">luxurious lifestyles</a>, courtesy of his family's legacy of wealth.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/72cf1966ec15256a.jpg><p class=align-left>He is the heir to the <a href=#>strings of businesses</a> that his late father used to head before his demise. Although these businesses are primarily smeared in corruption controversies, it has not stopped the family from continuously expanding their wealth.</p><p class=align-left>Robert once shared a picture of a shoe worth ~£10,000 on his social media. Besides, Robert Peter <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Mugabe Jr's cars </a>will also give you an insight into his exquisite taste. He is the proud owner of a unique automobile that has stunning similarities with the type of <a href=#>cars</a> that Batman drives in the Disney Comic series.</p><p class=align-left>He lives in beautiful accommodation wherever he finds himself; the house where he stays in Sandhurst, South Africa, is a good example.</p><h2>Social media presence</h2><p class=align-left>Robert Peter Mugabe Jr's Twitter presence is not loud, and he occasionally pops in to comment on national discourse. However, he <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">got into trouble</a> with some trolls about two years ago when he eulogised his late father during the one-year remembrance ceremony.</p><p class=align-left>Robert Peter Mugabe Jr may have all the good things that money can buy, but some of his recent interviews also portray him as someone trying to become a better version of himself. He has taken up the mantle of becoming responsible for the Mugabe household since the passing of his father.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO</strong>: <a href=#>Jack Dorsey's net worth in 2022, age, wife, education, IQ, house, profiles</a></p><p class=align-left><a href=#>Jack Dorsey’s net worth</a> is quite mouthwatering.</p><p class=align-left>As published on <a href=#>We</a>, his early participation in harnessing technology for developing social apps contributed to his net worth.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop6yp7jYZ5qoZqqWfKetwq2qZqSZm7KprcKkqmiblaGyo77IraCeq12XtrCz0ZqnoaGVqHxyfpVqcGplp528br7Om5yrrF2lsrWx0Wakrp%2BRl7JuttFmmKCdXZe2sHnEnaycmaSevK95z6umn6GcmsBur8Crqmamlal6uLvRrZ9o</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-ben-domenech-see-all-the-facts-about-him.html><span>←</span><span>Who Is Ben Domenech?
