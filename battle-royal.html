A Battle Royal involves four <a href=# title="Pokémon Trainer">Trainers</a> all battling each other at the same time. The format is based on the battles that the four <a href=# title="Guardian deities">guardian deities</a> of <a href=# title=Alola>Alola</a> take part in to decide who is the strongest of them all.</p><p>Battle Royals are held at the <a href=# title="Battle Royal Dome">Battle Royal Dome</a>. In a Battle Royal, each Trainer brings up to three <a href=# title="Pokémon (species)">Pokémon</a> into the ring, using one Pokémon at a time. At the end of a turn, if a Trainer has no Pokémon left, the Battle Royal ends. All participants are scored based on the number of Pokémon they <a href=# title=Fainting>knocked out</a>, and the number of Pokémon they have remaining.</p><p>Occasionally, <a href=# title="Professor Kukui">the Masked Royal</a> will appear as one of the opponents in the Master Rank.</p><h2><span class=mw-headline id=Mechanics>Mechanics</span></h2><p>During a Battle Royal, any Pokémon can target any of the other three opposing Pokémon as a target. If a Pokémon faints, any moves subsequently used that had targeted that fainted Pokémon alone will fail. Moves that hit multiple targets will hit all three opponents, but the damage of these moves is reduced by 50%.</p><p><a href=# class=mw-redirect title="Entry hazard">Entry hazard</a> moves create separate entry hazards on all three opponents' sides of the field. <a href=# title="Flame Burst (move)">Flame Burst</a> inflicts its extra damage to both opponents the user did not target, regardless of their relative positions. <a href=# title="Imposter (Ability)">Imposter</a> copies the opponent directly opposite the Pokémon.</p><p>It is impossible to forfeit in a Battle Royal.</p><p>Because the battle ends when one participant is eliminated instead of three, this prevents stalling strategies from becoming dominant where one side attempts to only defend while the other three sides attack and weaken each other.</p><h2><span class=mw-headline id=Scoring>Scoring</span></h2><p>If a Trainer's Pokémon knocks out an opposing Pokémon, that Trainer receives a point. If a Pokémon faints due to indirect damage, such as <a href=# title="Poison (status condition)">poison</a> or <a href=# title="Burn (status condition)">burn</a>, the point is awarded to the Pokémon who caused the indirect damage to occur. If a Pokémon faints due to self-inflicted damage or effects, such as from <a href=# title=Recoil>recoil</a> or <a href=# title="Explosion (move)">Explosion</a>, no points will be awarded to anyone.</p><p>The battle is over at the end of the turn after all of any one Trainer's Pokémon have fainted. The winner is determined based on the combined total of the KO points they earned and their remaining conscious Pokémon. If there is a tie using this method, the winner will be determined based on whose Pokémon have the most remaining HP. A Trainer who had all of their Pokémon faint cannot win, even if they have the most points, unless all three opponents also lost all of their Pokémon.</p><h2><span class=mw-headline id=In_the_anime>In the anime</span></h2><a href=# class=image><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/thumb/f/f9/Battle_Royal_anime.png/375px-Battle_Royal_anime.png decoding=async width=250 height=141 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> A Battle Royal in the <a href=# title="Pokémon anime">anime</a><p>Battle Royals were first introduced in <i><a href=# title=SM063>Pushing the Fiery Envelope!</a></i>. <a href=# title="Ash Ketchum">Ash</a> watched a televised match of the <a href=# title="Professor Kukui (anime)">Masked Royal</a> taking on <a href=# title="Battle Royal Trainers">three other Trainers</a> and their <a href=# title="Machamp (Pokémon)">Machamp</a>, <a href=# title="Primarina (Pokémon)">Primarina</a>, and <a href=# title="Decidueye (Pokémon)">Decidueye</a> at the <a href=# title="Battle Royal Dome">Battle Royal Dome</a>, easily defeating all three opposing Pokémon with his <a href=# title="Professor Kukui's Incineroar">Incineroar</a>. The Masked Royal announced an event where any volunteers would get a chance to face him in a Battle Royal, prompting Ash and <a href=# title="Ash's friends">his classmates</a> to travel to the Battle Royal Dome.</p><p>Due to Ash's <a href=# title="Litten (Pokémon)">Litten</a> jumping down from the stands to face its evolved form, the Masked Royal chose to invite Ash in a Battle Royal, along with <a href=# title="Kiawe (anime)">Kiawe</a> and <a href=# title="Sophocles (anime)">Sophocles</a>. However, even when holding back, the Masked Royal's Incineroar was more than a match for all of its opponents, easily defeating <a href=# title="Kiawe's Marowak">Kiawe's Marowak</a> and <a href=# class=mw-redirect title="Sophocles's Charjabug">Sophocles's Charjabug</a> with a <a href=# title="Darkest Lariat (move)">Darkest Lariat</a>.

However, when the Revengers started attacking the Masked Royal's Incineroar before the battle had even begun, <a href=# class=mw-redirect title="Ash's Torracat">Ash's Torracat</a> leaped down from the stands and stopped them. The boss of the Revengers, <a href=# title=Viren>Viren</a>, appeared and challenged the Masked Royal and Ash to a tag match, threatening to buy out the dome should they lose. The two accepted the challenge, and the Masked Royal gave Ash a mask of his own, giving him his own Battle Royal identity as the "Ash Royal". During the tag match, both sides kept swapping turns with their partners, with Incineroar and Torracat facing off against <a href=# title="Mad Magmar">Mad Magmar</a>'s <a href=# title="Magmortar (Pokémon)">Magmortar</a> and <a href=# title="Mr. Electric">Mr. Electric</a>'s <a href=# title="Electivire (Pokémon)">Electivire</a>.

Although Viren tried to force his way despite the loss, the "Double Royals" easily swept him aside, securing the dome's future.</p><p>In <i><a href=# title=SM129>Battle Royal 151!</a></i>, the preliminary round of the <a href=# title="Manalo Conference">Manalo Conference</a> was a massive Battle Royal between the 151 competing Trainers. The Battle Royal was called off when 16 Trainers remained, moving said Trainers on to the actual tournament.</p><p>In <i><a href=# title=JN112>Helping the Hometown Hero!</a></i>, a Battle Royal was held at the Battle Royal Dome to celebrate the homecoming of Ash, who had become a massive celebrity in the region after earning the title of <a href=# title="Alola League">Alola League</a> <a href=# title="Pokémon Champion">Champion</a>.
