"I love Danny. He's wonderful and we dated longer than people think we did. …I respect Danny's privacy, so it's not something we really talk about."</p><p>The couple's May-December romance <a href=#>quietly came to an end</a> earlier this month. And though the A-list pair rarely spoke about their romance in public, Dawson and the British director, 56, had nothing but good things to say about one another throughout the course of their relationship.</p><p>"From the outside it looks like there's a lot of dissimilarities, but we actually have a lot in common. We're really similar people," Dawson told Access Hollywood in October 2012. "It was just one of those things where we were going to just go our separate ways had someone not said something."</p><p>Boyle, who directed Dawson in upcoming film Trance, declined to talk about his personal life during an interview with The Mail on Sunday's Live magazine on March 2, opting to instead just praise his ex's lack of vanity.</p><p>Dawson similarly kept details of their courtship to a minimum during the Net-A-Porter interview, only saying that she "met Danny years ago" on a project neither of them ended up doing.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>"I don't always remember meetings, they kind of sometimes disappear," she said. "This one I really remembered. The questions he asked, how he guided it, the way he directed me was just so compelling."</p><p>Earlier this month, the estranged pair kept their interactions to a minimum at the press junket for Trance.</p><p>"He was talking to a group so people when she arrived and it was awkward — like a cold greeting, no hug, and they got through it as quickly as possible," a source told <a href=#><strong>Us</strong></a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGarp6OWv6q7jJ2YsKufo3qntc2ao6WxXZi8r7LIq6SsZaOluarAjJ%2BpqKVdmbazscKtpqtllJa7r8WMm6aypJVixKZ5w5qrnpxdobyvs8SrZK2gkaN6sbHOqaOeZaSdtq%2B3jGtnamtiboBw</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sweater-dress-petites.html><span>←</span><span>Petite Sweater Dresses - Shop Petite Sweater Dresses</span></a>
