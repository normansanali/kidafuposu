On July 9, Dudieva withdrew from the contest due to sickness, and Nunes was subsequently slated to go on Leslie Smith.</p><p>Smith also pulled out due to an injury, so Nunes ended up competing against Raquel Pa’aluhi. Due to a rear-naked choke in the opening round, Nunes was able to win the contest by technical submission.</p><p>At Invicta FC 4: Esparza vs. Hyatt on January 5, 2013, Nunes made a comeback to the organization to take on Sarah D’Alelio.

On July 9, 2016, at UFC 200, she competed against Miesha Tate for the UFC Women’s Bantamweight Championship.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/media.ghgossip.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/11101322/image-203.png><p>Tate was initially taken aback by Nunes’ knees and punches, and in the first round, the fight was won by rear-naked choke submission. She became the first openly homosexual UFC champion thanks to her triumph.</p><p>In the main event of UFC 207 on December 30, 2016, Nunes successfully defended her championship against Ronda Rousey, who had recently returned to the sport. 48 seconds into the first round, punches from Nunes resulted in a TKO victory.</p><p>The coaches for The Ultimate Fighter 30 on ESPN+, which included heavyweight and women’s flyweight competitors, were revealed to be Amanda Nunes and Julianna Pea on February 5, 2022.</p><p>On June 10, 2023, UFC 289 was slated to feature a trilogy matchup vs Julianna Pea.
