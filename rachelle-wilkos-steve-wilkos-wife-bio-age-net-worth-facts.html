Much more than her role as executive producer on her husband’s show, Wilkos is also a super mom to their two grown-up children. This piece digs right into what it feels like to manage your man; not in the other way now, but professionally.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=who-is-rachelle-wilkos-and-how-old-is-she></span><strong>Who Is Rachelle Wilkos and How Old Is She?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Rachelle Wilkos was born—Rachelle Lynn Consiglio—in St. Clair Shores, Michigan, the United States on January 11, 1971. Although not much is known about her father, it is known that her mom, Maggie Varney, is a hair-dresser famous for founding Wigs 4 Kids; an organization that makes wigs for children fighting cancer and other diseases that result in hair loss. Besides her work in this capacity have earned her the award of Detroit News Michigander of the Year for 2010.</p><p>Though details regarding her early life aren’t publicly known, it came to light that Rachelle Wilkos was raised in Michigan where she attended Lakeland High School; graduating in 1989. Following her graduation, she then proceeded to Wayne State University where she majored in journalism radio/TV.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=rachelle-wilkos-career></span><strong>Rachelle Wilkos’ Career</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Fresh from college, Wilkos began working as an intern at a local morning show Company back in 1994. Her dedication and hard work would pay off, as she rose to the become associate producer on the programme. But not too long after her promotion, Wilkos left Company to go work for Springer on The Jerry Springer Show; as senior producer. This was in 1995. She became an executive producer in 2008 when Richard Dominick was leaving the show. After working eighteen seasons on the show, she left for another unnamed show which, sources say, was more dear to her. As of this writing, Wilkos works as executive producer on her husband’s eponymous show, The Steve Wilkos Show.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=net-worth-and-other-facts-about-steve-wilkos-wife></span><strong>Net Worth, and Other Facts About Steve Wilkos’ Wife<br></strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=1-net-worth></span><strong>1. Net Worth</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>As of 2019, there are no sources that state Rachelle Wilkos’ exact net worth. However, if marriage is anything to go by, it’s safe to say that she shares her husband’s estimated net worth of $7 million. Although it’s unclear how much she earns annually, an executive producer of her class surely carts home a sizeable amount of Benjamins. Her asset may not be publicly known, nevertheless, her husband owns a summer house in Camp Lake, Wisconsin.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=2-rachelle-wilkos-is-a-mother-of-two></span><strong>2. Rachelle Wilkos is a Mother of Two</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Rachelle Wilkos has been married to her media famous husband Steve Wilkos, since 2000. Although she serves as his executive producer on his show, she doubles that with her role as wife and mother to their two children; Ruby (b. October 14, 2003) and Jack (b. June 19, 2005). Rachelle first met Steve through Springer when he was working as security personnel on the show. They began dating for an undisclosed number of years before tying the knot in 2001. Until 2009, Wilkos and her family lived in Park Ridge, Illinois. That year, they moved to Darien, Connecticut when her husband’s Show shifted its production-base to Stamford. In 2015, the couple reportedly sold off the Park Ridge property for a whopping $750,000.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=3-she-is-steve-wilkos-third-wife></span><strong>3. She is Steve Wilkos’ Third Wife</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Although Rachelle Wilkos is the mother of their only two children, she won’t be Steve’s first wife. Wilkos has been married twice before; to Rasae Wilkos back in 1985. But the marriage ended in divorce only two years later in 1987. He then married Hannah Wilkos in 1999 but got divorced the same year. So far, she’s been the longest staying wife; already nearing two decades together.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=4-height-and-body-measurements></span><strong>4. Height and Body Measurements</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Rachelle Wilkos has over the years maintained a graceful slim figure. She has light brown hair and blue eyes. There are no sources specifying her exact height. However, it is quite obvious that she stands slightly lower than her husband who is 6 feet 3 inches (1.91 meters) tall and weighs 85 kg (187 pounds). Wilkos does sports an hourglass body type whose measurements are yet to make their way to the media.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKqRmLWmuMueZLChnKC8tHnSrZyvnV2stq23zqxksKGWmnqjtc5mmKCdXaOytXnWqKmtoF2brqTA0mg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./nikocado-avocado-3.html><span>←</span><span>Nikocado Avocado Age, Net Worth, Husband, Family and Biography (Updated 2023)</span></a>
