The only way to gain Armor Charge is by <strong>having the right mods on and picking up Orbs of Power</strong>.</p><p data-characters=52 data-current-count=187 data-injectable=false><strong>Related:</strong> <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Best Arc Titan Build in Destiny 2 Lightfall</a></p><p data-characters=185 data-current-count=372 data-injectable=false>On its own, Armor Charge doesn’t do anything. However, when paired with the right mods, Armor Charge can be powerful. Essentially, <strong>Armor Charge is a buff centered all around mods</strong>.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>How to Use Armor Charge in Destiny 2</h2><p data-characters=199 data-current-count=571 data-injectable=true><strong>Armor Charge is extremely powerful</strong> in Destiny 2 and you’ll more than likely see the best players use it in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the World First Root of Nightmares Raid Race</a>. However, you need to know how to use it.</p><p data-characters=168 data-current-count=168 data-injectable=false>To use Armor Charge, you first need to equip mods that get you Armor Charge. <strong>Mods that give you Armor Charge are only the blue mods</strong>. Nothing else gets you Armor Charge.</p><p data-characters=143 data-current-count=311 data-injectable=false>The blue mods found on your Helmet, Gauntlets, Chest, Leg, and Class armor allow you to <strong>gain one Armor Charge when you pick up an Orb of Power</strong>.</p><p data-characters=225 data-current-count=536 data-injectable=true>The specific mods also grant you <strong>a bonus to a specific stat</strong>, like Font of Restoration is a blue mod that grants you an Armor Charge after picking up an Orb of Power and, when Armor Charge is on, gives you a boost to Recovery.</p><p data-characters=301 data-current-count=301 data-injectable=false><strong>Armor Charge decays over time</strong>, so continue to make and pick up Orbs of Power to keep that boost to whichever stats you have selected via the blue mods Also, <strong>all the blue mods can be stacked</strong> on one armor piece to increase the potency of the effect but it will offer diminishing returns with each stack.</p><p data-characters=309 data-current-count=610 data-injectable=true>On top of providing a boost to a specific stat, <strong>Armor Charge can be used in coordination with yellow mods</strong> which always grant a specific ability energy when that specific ability is expended, but will also consume all the stacks of Armor Charge currently available to provide additional energy to that ability.</p><p data-characters=337 data-current-count=337 data-injectable=false><strong>For example</strong>, if you have the Grenade Kickstart yellow mod, when you expend your Grenade energy and you have two Armor Charge stacks because you picked up two Orbs of Power, you’ll consume the two stacks of Armor Charge and get even more Grenade Energy. This is how you build the best builds in the game like <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the Void Warlock build</a>.</p><p data-characters=258 data-current-count=595 data-injectable=false>And that is what Armor Charge is and how it works in Destiny 2. <strong>Armor Charge is a very useful buff</strong> in Destiny 2 that you’ll want to utilize to make the best builds, so take advantage of it as you work to make <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the best Hunter Lightfall builds</a> available.</p><i data-stringify-type=italic>Attack of the Fanboy is supported by our audience.
