However, in an interview with Access Hollywood earlier this year, <strong>Uma opened up about why she was initially nervous about her eldest child embarking on a Hollywood career.</strong></p><p id=eRBHnQW6q-jp data-wc=1><strong>MORE:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>Fate: The Winx Saga showrunner opens up about show's future beyond season two</a></strong></p><p id=ezo-q66RV0MG data-wc=1><strong>MORE:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>Ginny and Georgia season two release date teased by showrunner - and it's so soon</a></strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/ac9ceaae45e2-maya-hawke-uma-thurman-z.jpg><p id=eBngKIChwRQke data-wc=5><strong>Uma Thurman is Maya's mother</strong></p><p id=evEYWAB_FtRvi data-wc=38>"Because it's a complicated career, and one public-facing so often, and she's a sensitive person," the Pulp Fiction star explained, adding: "I think any protective parent would be anxious for their child to go into their public area."</p><p id=eQYQx6FHlHQNw data-wc=64>Uma continued: "But she's, in the end, such a brilliant actress, obviously there's nothing else she would have done." Ethan has also spoken publicly about their daughter working in the same field. The Moon Knight actor told Yahoo: <strong>"It's kind of fun for Maya and I both to be working in such a mainstream milieu that I haven't spent a lot of time in."</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/2404565b15b8-maya-and-ethan-hawke-z.jpg><p id=efh4EpsIYUN9Y data-wc=6><strong>Maya with her dad, Ethan Hawke</strong></p><p id=eJqRRkGBseMGk data-wc=47>Uma herself has spoken out about having such well-known parents and the impact it has had on her career.
