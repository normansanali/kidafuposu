<a href=../../../../is-it-safe-to-leave-a-heat-lamp-on-all-night-html.html></a>
Answer
It is OK to leave your heat lamp on all night since you must maintain a certain temperature in the brooder. According to me, the red light is the greatest. Make sure they have enough space in the brooder to move away from the circle of light if they need to, and they will learn to control their own temperature.
As a result, are heat lights a potential fire hazard?</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Meet Tortilla Man Michael Pfaff! His Bio, Net Worth, Wife, Height</h2><time>Aug 21, 2024</time>
