While Anand played with AT&T’s other launch device - the Samsung Focus - and later on the LG Optimus 7, I got to play with the HTC Surround. HTC's entry into the fray stands out on AT&T. Ok, that was a terrible pun.&nbsp;

I lie awake I’ve gone to ground I’m watching porn In my hotel dressing gown Now I dream of you But I still believe
There’s only enough for one in this Lonely hotel suite
The journey’s long
And it feels so bad
I’m thinking back to the last day we had
Old moon fades into the new Soon I know I’ll be back with you
I’m nearly with you
I’m nearly with you When I’m weak I draw strength from you And when you’re lost I know how to change your mood And when I’m down you breathe life over me Even though we’re miles apart we are each other’s destiny</article><article class=post-entry><h2>96 MB of L3 3D V-Cache Designed For Gamers</h2><time>Jul 3, 2024</time>
