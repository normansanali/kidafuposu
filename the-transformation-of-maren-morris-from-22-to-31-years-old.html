With that being said, she has still been keeping listeners fed with new material. In 2021, she teamed up with Canadian hitmaker JP Saxe for "<a href=#>Line by Line</a>." That same year, she released a duet with her husband, <a href=#>Ryan Hurd</a>, titled "<a href=#>Chasing After You</a>."</p><p dir=ltr>At award shows, Morris continues to clean up. At the 2021 American Country Music Awards, she picked up Song of the Year for "The Bones" and Female Artist of the Year, according to <a href=#>CNN Entertainment</a>. At the <a href=#>iHeartRadio Music Awards</a>, she received nods for Country Artist of the Year and Country Song of the Year. At the <a href=#>2021 Grammy Awards</a>, she performed her hit "The Bones" alongside John Mayer.</p><p dir=ltr>If there is anything to learn from Morris's success, it's to never give up on your dreams. From self-released albums that got very little recognition to performing on some of the biggest stages, she proves that anything is possible if you put your mind to it. As of 2021, she is worth an <a href=#>impressive $3 million</a>, and it certainly seems like we can expect that figure to grow.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbHBnaoV0e9OhnGasopa7tLLOq6SarJmku267xWakmqqVo3quu9GroKxllqe8rnmRa2Stp11ofm7FxJqprGWfobFw</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./queen-latifah.html><span>←</span><span>Queen Latifah</span></a>
