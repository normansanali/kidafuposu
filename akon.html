And I think that’s what separates the legends from the regular artists. It’s all in how you manage that success, and how you deal with the controversy when it actually comes.”&nbsp;<strong>– Akon&nbsp;</strong></p><p class=qt_575373>“That’s my actual payment, the fact that I can actually make something that I actually enjoy and put on repeat, and it’s not related to anything else or anyone else’s thoughts and ideas, it all came from me; I just love that aspect of it.”&nbsp;<strong>– Akon</strong></p><p>“I always felt like if you get to a point where you’ve got enough money to invest in something real, you gotta invest in anything that’s related to a natural resource because that’s gonna be here forever – so you might as well invest in something that’s gonna be here, rather than invest in something that’s gonna wear out.”&nbsp;<strong>– Akon</strong></p><h3><span style=text-decoration:underline><strong>You may also like; <a href=# rel=bookmark>Snoop Dogg Net Worth</a></strong></span></h3><p>“Any album that you pick up of mine, you know it’s an Akon album. The guests are very limited, and you get to really feel the experience. You get the Akon experience when you get the albums. I always want to make sure that stays the way it is. Don’t want to flood the album to where you lose focus on why you bought it.”&nbsp;<strong>– Akon&nbsp;</strong></p><p>“I always feel like ‘as long as I’m doin’ what I love to do, the money’s naturally gonna come.’ When you start thinkin’ business and you start thinkin’ ‘What’s hot? What’s the wave? Who is hot? Let’s get at that person,’ it becomes a point where you’re tryin’ to strategize to make money. And that’s always a gamble.”&nbsp;<strong>– Akon&nbsp;</strong></p><p>“While I’m here, I’m gonna milk it for all I can, so when I’m no longer hot – and I know that day is coming – I will step over here and enjoy everything I’ve created up to this point. The music is just opening all these doors, so I can relax.”&nbsp;<strong>– Akon&nbsp;</strong></p><h2><strong>Frequently Asked Questions</strong></h2><h3><strong>How much is Akon worth?</strong></h3><p>His net worth is estimated to be $60 Million.</p><h3><strong>How old is Akon?</strong></h3><p>He was born on April 16, 1973, and is currently 49 years old.</p><h3><strong>How tall is Akon?</strong></h3><p>His height is 1.80 m, which is equal to 5 ft 11 in.</p><h2><span id=summary class=ez-toc-section></span><strong>Summary</strong></h2><p>Akon has been one of the most popular music icons in many decades.
