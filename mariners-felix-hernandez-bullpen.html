And I certainly don't take any of this lightly, but I just think trying to make the best decision for the ballclub and really the best decision for Felix at this point is just take a breath. Step back, gather yourself."</p><p>Hernandez has spent his entire 14-year career with the Mariners (398 starts) and it wasn't too long ago that he was one of the most dominant pitchers in the league. He is a six-time All-Star, he won the American League Cy Young Award in 2010, he pitched a perfect game in 2012, and in 2014, he led the American League with a 2.14 ERA (the best of his career).</p><p>Things have been going downhill since that great 2014 season though, and this season he is 8-10 in 23 starts (0-4 in his last five starts) and has a worst-of-his-career 5.73 ERA. But, Servais also left the door open to Hernandez earning back his place in the starting rotation:</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Certainly, respect him and everything he's done here throughout his career, but these things happen and ultimately it's about the team. It's never easy, but again hopefully he takes it the right way. He'll get a chance to pitch at some point down there and maybe he can work his way back in the rotation. We'll see. He'll let us know on that."</p><p>As of now, Servais has not yet decided who will be taking over Hernandez's spot in the rotation.</p><p style=text-align:center><strong>RELATED: <a href=#>TOP OVERRATED (AND UNDERRATED) PLAYERS IN THE MLB TODAY</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKeoqqSowaa%2BjZympmeemsS0e8yaqaKmlafAbrLEpaCxZZiav6%2BtzZ2cs2WSqrmtvMSnZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./uzma-syeda-md.html><span>←</span><span>Dr. Uzma Syeda, MD Grapevine, TX</span></a>
