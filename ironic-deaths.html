As <a href=# rel=noopener>UPI</a> reported at the time, Moody’s tragic death was marred by bitter irony when the full context of his demise was revealed.</p><p>Moody had been one of 200 people at a party thrown by the New Orleans Recreation Department. The reason for the occasion was to celebrate the end of the first summer season in memory with no drownings.</p><p>Roughly half of the party guests in attendance were lifeguards, and four of them were officially on duty during the festivities. Moody was not a lifeguard, but he was fully clothed and had not been swimming with the other guests. However, he somehow ended up slipping into the water undetected.</p><p>“The lifeguards were really upset. It’s a real tragedy,” said Director Madlyn Richard. “This was the first annual party in memory where they could celebrate a trouble-free season. We had all been talking about it. It was the first season without a single [drowning] incident.”</p><p>Moody’s body wasn’t discovered until the party was over, when the four on-duty lifeguards were clearing the pool. And though they attempted to revive him, their efforts were ultimately unsuccessful.</p><p>An autopsy confirmed drowning as the cause of Jerome Moody’s death.</p><p>After reading about some of history’s most ironic deaths, learn about the <a href=#>10 most embarrassing celebrity deaths in history</a>.
