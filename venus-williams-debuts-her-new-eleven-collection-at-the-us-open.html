The 40-year-old unveiled the line’s latest drop on Monday, August 31 — and she gave Us Weekly Stylish exclusive details about the fashion newness.</p><p>“We are introducing some really gorgeous, iridescent tennis pieces in this collection that will add a bit of flair and fun to your activewear outfit,” the tennis pro told Us. “The collection features elevated tennis skirts, dresses, tanks and jackets that are designed to make you shine both on and off the court. They are feminine, flirty and fabulous.”</p><p>Naturally, Williams loves all of the pieces in the collection — she designed them, after all. But if she had to choose just one, it would be the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Luminosity Skirt</a> ($78), which she describes as the “perfect blend of fashion and function.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Venus-Williams-New-Collection-Inline-2.jpg><p>Not only did she tell us that it’s her favorite, but she proved it on the court at the 2020 US Open Championships on September 1, 2020, wearing the skirt and the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Race Day Tank Top in Blush</a> ($69).</p><p>Williams launched her fashionable activewear brand, EleVen, in 2007 and she’s no stranger to wearing her pieces on the court — including at the Olympic games. But besides fashion, she’s <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">also skincare-obsessed</a>. In May 2020, she expanded her line by launching SPF products with Credo, specifically <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">On-The-Defense Sunscreen SPF 30</a> and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Unrivaled Sun Serum SPF 30</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Venus-Williams-New-Collection-Inline-1.jpg><p>It’s also designed with four-way stretch for comfort and has ozone protection to give you keep you extra safe from ultraviolet rays (but you still need to wear your sunscreen, of course). That ozone protecting fabric technology is called EleVen Ozone.</p><p>“Sun protection is so important – even in your clothing,” explains Williams. “That’s why I made EleVen Ozone a true staple of this collection. I pair my Shine outfit with EleVen x Credo’s new SPF products to make sure I’m protected head-to-toe. No one wants wrinkles.”</p><p>The most important message that Williams wants to emphasize with her new Shine collection is that “women can be powerful and feminine at the same time”</p><p>“Just because I’m a professional athlete doesn’t mean I can’t rock some sparkle and shine on the court,” she concluded. “When I put on pieces from this collection, it makes me confident and ready to go.”</p><p>With reporting by Marc Lupo</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p><strong>Listen on Spotify to Get Tressed With Us to get the details of every hair love affair in Hollywood, from the hits and misses on the red carpet to your favorite celebrities’ street style ‘dos (and don’ts!)</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX6uyr8HSZq6ipJyerq6%2FjJ2cm62kqHqpsdFmpZ6vXZq5psLEp2Scp5yhsqTAyKilZpmkYsGpsYyuqmanoJq7cA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-meaning-behind-the-song-fairytale-of-philadelphia-by-the-philly-specials-jason-kelce-travis-kelce.html><span>←</span><span>The Meaning Behind The Song: Fairytale of Philadelphia by The Philly Specials, Jason Kelce &amp;amp; Travis</span></a>
