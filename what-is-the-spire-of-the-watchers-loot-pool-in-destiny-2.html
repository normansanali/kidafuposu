Here’s what you need to know about the loot pool for Spire of the Watcher in Destiny 2.</p><h2>All rewards for Spire of the Watcher dungeon in Destiny 2</h2><p data-injection=true>The first round of Spire of the Watcher’s armor loot was datamined. The armor will be available as a chance to appear following each encounter. You should expect to see this relatively often after completing each boss encounter in the dungeon. It has been confirmed that the Warlock boots do have spurs on them.</p><p><strong>Related</strong>: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">How to start Spire of the Watcher dungeon in Destiny 2</a></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-injection=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>NEW: Spire of the Watcher Dungeon Armor | <a href=#>#Destiny2</a></p><p>(via Elliott) <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/ie2CjiyYfv</a></p>— Destiny Bulletin (@DestinyBulletn) <a href=#>December 6, 2022</a></figure><p>The armor is called TM-Moss Custom suit.

Here’s a breakdown of the weapons you can earn while working on the Spire of the Watcher dungeon.</p><ul><li>Hierarchy of Needs (exotic bow)</li><li>Liminal Vigil (sidearm)</li><li>Long Arm (scout rifle)</li><li>Seventh Seraph Carbine (auto rifle)</li><li>Terminus Horizon (machine gun)</li><li>Wilderflight (grenade launcher)</li></ul><p>The Hierarchy of Needs bow will be the toughest weapon to acquire of the available ones, as it will be the dungeon’s exotic. You will want to complete it multiple times to try grabbing it in your vault. The same goes for the other weapons, but you have a much better chance of earning them from the encounters.</p><h3>About the author</h3><img alt src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/secure.gravatar.com/avatar/17c418c90324bdc0fbd0bc2ce42fdf32?s=192&d=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamepur.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2020%2F01%2Fcropped-gamepur_favicon-1-192x192.png&r=g2x" height=96 width=96 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h3>Zack Palm</h3><p class=author-url></p><p class=author-desc>Zack Palm is the Senior Writer of Gamepur and has spent over five years covering video games, and earned a Bachelor's degree in Economics from Oregon State University.
