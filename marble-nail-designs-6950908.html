It was one of those Y2K beauty trends that felt new yet timeless, and we've got to say that we were all onto something. After all, there's a reason why marble countertops have continued to reign as backdrops for so many product Instagram pics.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Unsurprisingly, marble nails make for beautiful nail art, too.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">One of the many reasons marble nail designs continue to trend year after year is that they can be as subtle or as bold as you want them to be. You can play up short, round nails with muted shades or make long, squared nails stand out by painting them in bold, complimentary shades. Either way, there's a marble design for every personality and taste out there.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_4-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Below, we rounded up several of our favorite marble nails. From rose quartz-inspired manis to holographic nails inspired by galaxies, scroll to discover them all.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-black-marble-nails></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Black Marble Nails</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If you don't want to fully commit to a full marble set, dip your toes into the trend by sporting a few accent nails. Black is a timeless shade that matches with everything, so it's a good go-to when trying something outside your comfort zone.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-marbles-and-metallics></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Marbles and Metallics</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Another fun way to wear this trend is by combining different elements to create an unexpected look. Here, we love how hints of gold play up the opalescent&nbsp;blues and purples.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-technicolor-marble></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Technicolor Marble</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>&nbsp;Ilya S. Savenok/Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Be bold with your marbled mani and lean into bright, stand-out shades. They don't need to match, either. Let your creativity run wild and mix every shade your heart desires — the result is bound to boost your serotonin levels.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-blue-marble-nails></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Blue Marble Nails</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Translate a dreamy, stormy sky onto a swoon-worthy nail design.

Meshing black, marbled specks on top of a grey base feels edgy, but at the same time, this classic color combo is safe and timeless.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-rose-quartz-nails></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Rose Quartz Nails</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The love crystal makes it way to your tips via this feminine manicure.
