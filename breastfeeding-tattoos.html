I stopped nursing Dev a week shy of her turning three, and I can easily say those three years were the hardest yet most rewarding experiences I will ever get. Not only was I able to grow her in my body, but I was able to sustain her life for years Earthside and create a bond that I cannot imagine not having. It also allowed me the most growth because it became very clear that my life, my body, wasn’t mine anymore. Many days were awful awful awful and I hated breastfeeding and did not like my child, but I’d tell myself it’d be worth it in the end. All the hours of pumping through nursing school and work, the endless nights of feedings, the constant touching (uh, that didn’t stop with weaning!) and did I mention the touching? Seven months after stopping and I can already say it was worth it! The years we had were so short and the benefits we both received will last a lifetime. This isn’t just a post to encourage mothers to breastfed (there are a million reasons why one can’t/won’t and it’s not my business) but it is a post to encourage those that do breastfeed to consider breastfeeding into toddlerhood. It’s hard, it’s great, it’s worth it and if you want to do it, YOU CAN. Make it work like the badass mother that you are. Fuck what society says about it being inappropriate. You do you, boo. Huge thank you to @tanintattoos from @mirrorgalleryflagstaff for merging two amazing pieces of art by @betty.ratbag. Easily my favorite tattoo and it makes me feel so empowered every time I look at it. #tattoo #tattooedmom #breastfed #breastfeeding #breastfedtoddler #weightoftheworld #breastfeedingtattoo #empoweringwomen #empowered #nursingschool #pumpingmom #breastmilk #liquidgold #fucksociety</a></p><p>A post shared by <a href=# rel=nofollow>Steffani Rideau</a> (@steffuhni) on Sep 5, 2018 at 1:56pm PDT</p><p>Steffani Rideau makes a case for breastfeeding into toddlerhood (she nursed until her daughter was three) in this Instagram post, but with a caveat we can all appreciate: “You do you, boo.” She also writes that her breastfeeding tattoo makes her feel empowered every day. Now that’s a reason to get ink.</p><p>Umm, a breastfeeding tattoo that comes with homemade vegan cookies?
