However, he has rarely come back to the ballroom since his season. In fact, this marks his first public appearance <a href=#>since his fatal car crash sentencing in August</a>.</p><p>The reality star was sentenced with two years of probation on August 23 for his part in an April 2017 crash. Soules allegedly rear-ended a tractor driven by 66-year-old <strong>Kenny Mosher</strong> in Aurora, Iowa. Mosher was transported to a local hospital and later <a href=#>died of injuries he sustained in the accident</a>. The former Bachelorette star was accused of leaving the scene before the police arrived.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Witney-Carson-Former-Dancing-with-the-Stars-Partner-Chris-Soules-in-Audience-02.jpg><p>“All I remember is <a href=#>waking up and just saying, ‘I need help.’</a> That’s all I knew is something bad had happened and I needed help,” Soules said in an interview with Good Morning America on September 19. “I don’t know that I was thinking clearly. I notified the authorities of what had happened, the paramedics were there, but now I know I was scared and wanted to be in a safer place. I just went home. When I left I called my parents. You know, they’re both in consensus [and] just said, ‘Call an attorney.’”</p><p>The Iowa native first appeared on season 10 of The Bachelorette in 2014, vying for <a href=#><strong>Andi Dorfman</strong></a>‘s heart. After coming in third place, he was named the lead for season 19 of The Bachelor, which ended in a proposal to <strong>Whitney Bischoff</strong>. However, the pair split two months after the finale aired.</p><p>Dancing With the Stars airs on ABC Mondays at 8 p.m. ET.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaK6irJ6axm6vwKuqqKZdrK60edKhppyjlZl6tbuMrJyeZZOdv6q%2FjKymrqSVqHqquoydrq2rXZbCpbXEp5qeZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-did-charles-slacks-do-army-veteran-charged-over-domestic-shooting-603978-html.html><span>←</span><span>What did Charles Slacks do?
