She was 28 years old. Now, she's 54 and is selling skin care products to fans that want to defy aging like her.</p><p>The Let's Get Loud performer launched JLo Beauty in 2021. At that time, fans slammed the brand and<a href=#> accused her of getting Botox and fillers</a>.</p><p>And just as people have turned the controversy into <a href=#>her new "cash grab," an alcohol line called Delola</a>, the scandalous beauty line is back in the spotlight after the filter in Lopez's promotional Instagram video glitched, revealing her true skin texture.</p><p>The former Super Bowl headliner — who claims that olive oil is the secret to her youthful skin — visibly had wrinkles in that clip. Many were quick to call it false advertisement while experts weighed in to evaluate how she really achieved her current look.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Have Jennifer Lopez And Rihanna Avoided Each Other Ever Since Their Mysterious Drake Feud?</a></span></p><h2 id=how-does-jennifer-lopez-stay-in-shape-in-her-50s>How Does Jennifer Lopez Stay In Shape In Her 50s?</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong><strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>JLo, who was <a href=#>recently locked out of her gym</a>, is big on lifting weights and rarely skips a workout session. "Sometimes, I work too late the night before, and I'm like: 'Ugh, I can't do this,'" she told Us Weekly. "But I tell myself: 'Just do it. It's only an hour.' It's just talking yourself off the ledge of being a lazy bum."</p><p>"I don't like [working out] later," she noted, "it's harder to get there when I have my day going already." Lopez works with two personal trainers, Dodd Romero and David Kirsch. The former revealed to Oprah Daily that the <a href=#>Maid in Manhattan alum</a> "trains for roughly an hour, four to five times a week, focusing on different body parts each time."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In a separate interview with Us Weekly, Romero said that they'd "go until everything's sore and we've hit every body part." On top of that, Lopez has her dance rehearsals. They're no joke either. Just check out her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">pole dancing prep for Hustlers on her YouTube channel</a>.</p><p>But for her, it's more of a serotonin booster as well. In 2016, the On the Floor hitmaker told Hello!: "Dance has always been a huge part of my life and taking the time to move my body and do something that's so good for me is key to my happiness."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>What Happened Between Jennifer Lopez And Sandra Bullock?</a></span></p><h2 id=is-jennifer-lopez-lying-about-her-olive-oil-skin-care-routine>Is Jennifer Lopez Lying About Her Olive Oil Skin Care Routine?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/gjgkgkg.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Here is a screenshot of the said glitch in Lopez's recent Instagram video where she was promoting a sports drink (thank god, it wasn't her own anti-aging line). DrMediSpa's founder, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Dr. Munir Somji shared the clip on his page</a> alongside an explanation for the pop star's olive oil skin care routine. "These filters can smooth out imperfections and create a flawless look, including a perfect complexion," he said of the filter.</p><p>He then noted that "JLO has previously shared her skincare routine and emphasised the importance of using natural products like olive oil and sunscreen. She has denied using anti-wrinkle injections and has her own skincare brand. However, it's important to note that even with a good skincare routine, everyone's skin is unique and may have imperfections or age-related changes."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The renowned cosmetic surgeon also reminded his 136,000 followers: "It's essential to remember that social media platforms like Instagram are curated spaces where people often present their best selves. Filters, editing, and other digital enhancements are commonly used to create a specific image or aesthetic."</p><p>He concluded the post by saying: "While it's great to appreciate and admire the beauty of individuals like JLO, it's important to maintain a balanced perspective and not compare oneself to heavily edited images." Comments on the original video weren't as polite. "I love how the filter deactivated on 'telling,'" one wrote. "Filter literally snitched on cue."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Jennifer Lopez Liked Balmain Creative Director's Creepy 'Love Letter' To Lily-Rose Depp</a></span></p><h2 id=has-jennifer-lopez-had-cosmetic-surgery>Has Jennifer Lopez Had Cosmetic Surgery?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/jennifer-lopez-looking-skeptical.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Pa Ti singer has firmly denied getting any work done on her face, including Botox and fillers. Responding to an Instagram comment accusing her of cosmetic surgery in 2021, she said: "For the 500 millionth time, I have never done Botox or any injectables or surgery ... And here is another JLO Beauty secret: don't spend your time trying to bring others down, that will keep you youthful & beautiful too!!"</p><p>But according to Dan Holtz, owner of Beverly Hills Rejuvenation Center (who hasn't treated Lopez), the two-time Grammy nominee did a "combination of things" to achieve her age-defiant appearance. "Judging by the much more youthful appearance I would say she did a combination of things," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the "Wellness Expert to the Stars" told OK! </a>in 2020.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"It looks as though Threads may have been used for lifting the cheeks and tightening up the jawline," he added. "She also likely used a neurotoxin like Botox to reduce lines in the skin. A small amount of filler was probably used under the eyes as well."</p><p>Another doctor, Pamella Agullo, agreed with the evaluation. "It is obvious that her skin quality is much better," she said of JLo's transformation over the years. "She has tighter pores and her fine wrinkles have disappeared. The skin is smooth which looks like she could have used facial fillers to restore volume loss."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGihnqaenrOmvoylpqmdqmLAra3MppydZZakv26ywKWqnmWjoLavr8CrnGaZlGKup8DEq2ShnaJitq%2B%2F05qeq5mdYrOquNOeqWafnJ7BpLTEnWY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jennifer-coolidge-husband-unveiling-the-american-pie-stars-relationship-history.html><span>←</span><span>Jennifer Coolidge Husband: Unveiling the American Pie Stars Relationship History</span></a>
