However, no official announcement came from the show or its parent company, iHeart Radio, and she’s been noticeably absent since Envy and Charlamagne returned from their holiday break.</p>AD<p>AD LOADING...</p><p>During the show on Wednesday (January 10), the pair addressed the confusion but didn’t acknowledge Jess or her announcement in their conversation.</p><p>“You know what I’m confused by?” Charlamagne began around the 2:34 mark of the clip below. “We spent all last year rotating guest co-hosts and I thought we was rotating guest co-hosts before we let God decide who was supposed to be in here. Now it’s 2024. What happened? Did we just say, ‘F it, there’s not gonna be another co-host?'”</p>AD<p>AD LOADING...</p><p>After DJ Envy agreed he was equally as confused and was adamant that they still needed a third mic, Charlamagne added: “Angela Yee, what I always say, is irreplaceable so it’s like the person that’s coming in here is not replacing anyone. If there’s somebody coming in here. That’s the whole point of me having this conversation. What the hell happened? I don’t know what the hell is happening.”</p><p>He continued: “It don’t feel like nothing. It ain’t no motion. What’s happening? I’m not even joking with y’all. I don’t know what the hell is going on. I don’t wanna rotate guest co-hosts no more, though.”</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.hiphopdx.com/assets/prod/icons/youtube-play.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/img.youtube.com/vi/rk_z0nflvXI/hqdefault.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p>On August 10, 2022, <a class=underline-link href=#>Angela Yee announced on-air her impending exit from the popular Power 105.1 show,</a> while revealing she’ll be hosting her very own nationally syndicated daily show on iHeartRadio.</p><p>“This is something that I’ve been wanting to do for years now, since way before the pandemic,” Yee began. “I had actually sat down with our big boss, Thea [Mitchem], and I was telling her, ‘Look, I really want to have my own show.’</p>AD<p>AD LOADING...</p><p>“You know I have my podcast,&nbsp;<a class=underline-link href=# rel=noopener>Lip Service</a>, and I was thinking I would be able to get something like a weekend situation. You know, one day ease into having my own show again; I did come from Sirius where I had&nbsp;The Morning After with Angela Yee, and then came here.”</p><p>She added: “So it’s always been a goal of mine to have that. And so I thought that I would still be on here and then do that show as well. But years later, they approached me up here at iHeart, Thea had a sit down with me, and told me that they’re gonna give me my very own show!</p><a class=related-article--container href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.hiphopdx.com/2023/12/sexyy-red-checks-jess-hilarious-during-breakfast-club-interview-i-dont-mess-with-you-250x142.jpeg alt="Sexyy Red Checks Jess Hilarious During 'Breakfast Club' Interview: 'I Don't Mess With You'" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=related-article--tagline>related<span> news</span></p><h3 class=related-article--title>Sexyy Red Checks Jess Hilarious During 'Breakfast Club' Interview: 'I Don't Mess With You'</h3><p class=related-article--meta-information>December 15, 2023</p></a><p>“I wasn’t sure what was happening when she first told me, but I am going to be leaving&nbsp;The Breakfast Club. You guys, obviously, will continue on and it’ll be a different iteration of&nbsp;The Breakfast Club, but I will have my own show up here at iHeart as well, so I’ll be part of the family.”</p><p>Despite seeming to leave the show on good terms, rumors persisted about Yee’s departure being for a more salacious reason — <a class=underline-link href=#>a claim The Breakfast Club co-host Charlamagne Tha God flatly denied in a May 2023 interview</a>.</p>AD<p>AD LOADING...</p><p>“I think people want it to be something salacious, but it’s not,” Charlamagne said. “She left&nbsp;Breakfast Club&nbsp;because she got the opportunity to do her own nationally syndicated show.&nbsp;Way Up With Angela Yee&nbsp;is a nationally syndicated show it comes on 10 am to 2pm right after&nbsp;The Breakfast Club, and I think that would be hard for anybody to pass up … Angela Yee never got the opportunity to host her own show on terrestrial radio.”</p><p>Since her departure, the show has rotated guest co-hosts including the aforementioned Jess Hilarious, Claudia Jordan, Jason Lee and more.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmigmaW1sLzDsWWcp51ku6bD0miaoZmioa6urcannGasmJZ6qLvDZpujZZWjw7p5wqiln62jmrFurtGemKSekajBbq%2FLrplmm59itbC%2F02aqnpmimLU%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./bar-paly-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Bar Paly Net Worth</span></a>
