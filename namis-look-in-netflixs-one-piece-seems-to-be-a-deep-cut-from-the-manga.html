Sadly, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">that attire never made its way into the original story</a>, but the live-action truly proved how faithful the story was by giving Nami that exact beloved design in the very first episode of the series.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit wp-block-embed-reddit" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=#>Just realized Nami’s introduction outfit is based on the old proto concept art.</a><br>by<a href=#>u/Bardiclaus</a> in<a href=#>OnePiece</a></figure><p data-characters=339 data-current-count=639 data-injectable=true>While the manga (or the anime) never featured Nami wearing those clothes, they perfectly encapsulate just how cool the navigator truly is. Not only did the live-action Nami <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">do justice to her original counterpart</a>, but the quirky outfit inspired by her early draft also showcased how unique her persona is, especially so early in the story.</p><p data-characters=437 data-current-count=437 data-injectable=true>Naturally, her oversized weapon of choice in the early design didn’t make it into the live-action. Instead, Nami wields her three-segment staff during fights – though eventually, we’ll witness her true nature as she and Usopp opt to flee from any altercations, choosing not to use her three-piece bo-staff after all. In the end, an axe that size just wouldn’t make much sense for the Nami that we know and love today.</p><p data-characters=136 data-current-count=136 data-injectable=false>In the meantime, to catch this nod to Eiichiro Oda’s first draft, the One Piece live-action is available for streaming on Netflix.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3yvrcyiqmakn6S4brXNZqWerJahtrm%2FjKilnmWgnrKksYysnJ6lo2LBsHnBnmSaZZSasrF5wq6rZp6ipLpuwMeeZKaZnpyucA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./lahna-turner.html><span>←</span><span>Lahna Turner</span></a>
