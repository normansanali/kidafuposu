Having the benefit of following the Super Bowl, Tracker‘s series premiere debuted on Sunday, Feb. 11, 2024, with subsequent episodes following weekly on Sundays at 9 pm ET/PT. For those who want to catch the series on streaming, thankfully you have a range of options. Various streamers offer the ability to livestream CBS, including <a href=#>Fubo</a>,&nbsp;<a href=#>Hulu with Live TV</a>,&nbsp;<a href=#>DirecTV Stream</a>,&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=#>YouTube TV</a>. Viewers who wish to go back and watch at a later date, meanwhile, should get themselves a subscription to Paramount Plus, on which all episodes drop after they air on cable.</p><h2 id=h-how-many-episodes-are-in-tracker data-injectable=false>How many episodes are in Tracker?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Justin-Hartley-in-‘Tracker.webp><p data-characters=393 data-current-count=693 data-injectable=true>With Tracker so early into its run at the time of writing, there is currently no concrete information available regarding exactly how long its first season will be. Present listings only reach up to the fourth episode, airing March 3. Seeing as this is a network drama we’re talking about, and not some streaming miniseries, it hardly seems likely the show will wrap up in just a month.</p><p data-characters=292 data-current-count=292 data-injectable=false>It’s much more probable that Tracker will go on to have at least 13 episodes, which is typical for a mid-season series such as this. Plus, if its Super Bowl-boosted premiere is any indication, ratings should be high enough to see it get renewed for a second run for the 2024/25 season.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y4tMSrnGabkaN6qnnWmqucoF2pv6Kvyp6pZpmemXqpu9ZmpJqmqWKysbXSqJueq12Wv6Z506Gcq51dnrtuv8SaqqimXaS7pns%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./taylor-swift-without-makeup-selfie-bed-cat-olivia.html><span>←</span><span>Taylor Swift Without Makeup She Woke Up Like This With Her Cat Hollywood Life</span></a>
