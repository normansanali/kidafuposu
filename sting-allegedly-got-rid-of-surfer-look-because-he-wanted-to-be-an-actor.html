I was the executive producer of Stings’ very first movie called&nbsp;The Real Reason Men Commit Crimes. I put the deal together and made it happen with Turner and funded it. Sting was taking acting lessons right around this time and working in that direction. Sting made up his mind, he didn’t want that blonde hair because you can’t get a movie, you can’t get a T.V. role with that look so he wanted more versatility.”</p><p>Sting will remain one of the mainstays of AEW television for a long time as he will undoubtedly stick with the company for years and end his career in AEW.</p><p>h/t to <a href=#>Wrestling Inc</a> for the quotes.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7XNoKqinJWjsri%2FjZympmdiZX9ye49wZmlwX6jBqrrGZpilpJWcsqW42GaeqKxdp7alec6fZKytopuys3nLqKakZZKasKLB0p5koZ1drK6vwMSdZK2nXZeybq3NZpicrJ%2BnfA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./simon-cowell-plastic-surgery.html><span>←</span><span>Simon Cowell Before And After Plastic Surgery: What Happened To His Face?</span></a>
