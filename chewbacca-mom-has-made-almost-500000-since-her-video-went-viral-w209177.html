Payne made bank when Southeastern University in Lakeland, Florida, gave her two young children college scholarships worth $400,000.</p><p><a href=#>As previously reported,</a> Payne went to Kohl’s to buy yoga pants, but instead left with the electronic Chewbacca mask, which makes the wookiee’s trademark sweet growling noise when the mouth opens. (The items retails for $29.99 at Target.) She posted the video on her Facebook page on May 19, and it’s since received more than 150 million views.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Payne opened up about her overnight stardom in an interview with <i>GMA </i>on May 23. “I was thinking, ‘I’ve got 30 minutes before I have to be responsible and pick up my children from school, and once they see this I’ll never get to see it again.’ So I thought, I’m going to share this with my Facebook friends and family, and if anybody wants to see it, they’re going to have to see it now. And I’m going to document. This was mine to begin with. This was never theirs,” she said at the time. “In all honestly, I think the world as a whole is in need of a good laugh. I think we’re in need of somebody to lift our spirits, to not take ourselves so seriously, and to maybe break some cynicism worldwide.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGacoJWsr6KvwppkpqedYrWiv4ymmJ2dXZa5rrvSrWRuaGBlfXF50qKlnJ1dnbKzedWim56nXayyr8CMr6CrmZxixHN8mGpucGc%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./carson-sobery-obituary-raising-money-for-a-better-tomorrow.html><span>←</span><span>Carson Sobery Obituary, Raising Money For A Better Tomorrow</span></a>
