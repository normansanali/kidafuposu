That was one of the worst days of my life,” she admitted. “You saw 10 minutes of five hours. … I’m not scared of her, but, like, she freaking flipped a switch that day.”</p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Siesta-Key-Cast-Talks-Costar-Crushes-Gaining-Weight-Quarantine-002.jpg alt="Siesta Key Cast Talks Costar Crushes Gaining Weight Quarantine" width=1000 height=557 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>The&nbsp;Siesta Key&nbsp;cast experienced a major shakeup earlier this week when <a href=#>MTV fired <strong>Alex Kompothecras</strong></a>. “We’ve made the decision to cut ties with Alex and are editing the current season to minimize his presence,” the network said in a statement to&nbsp;Us&nbsp;on Tuesday, June 16. “He will not be in future seasons of&nbsp;Siesta Key.” The move happened following several racially charged comments on the 25-year-old TV personality’s part.</p><p>Juliette, 22, <a href=#>reacted to the news</a> by slamming a fan who tweeted about no longer watching the show without Alex. “Sorry we picked trying to get rid of racism instead of thinking about your reality tv needs,” she wrote. “You still see all the drama, you just don’t see him.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Chloe added: “They aren’t worth it boo boo.
