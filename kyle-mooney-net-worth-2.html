Kyle is an actor, writer and comedian, probably best known for being a cast member of the TV show “Saturday Night Live” since 2013. One of his most popular segments is his “Man-on-the-street interviews” which have been featured in various shows, but all of his endeavors have helped put his net worth to where it is today.</p><p>How rich is Kyle Mooney? As of early-2018, sources estimate a net worth that is at $600,000, mostly earned through success in comedy, but he’s also appeared in television series, films, and is a regular sketch performer. As he continues his career, it is expected that his wealth will also continue to increase.</p><h3>Kyle Mooney Net Worth $600,000</h3><p>Growing up, Kyle aspired to a career on television, and consistently appeared in various school productions at Scripps Ranch High School, including in a production of Shakespeare’s “The Tempest” which won him a Best Actor award. After matriculating, he attended the University of Southern California, where he also indulged in comedy sketches with the group “Commedus Interruptus”.</p><p>After graduating, Mooney formed another comedy sketch group in 2007 called “Good Neighbor”, alongside <a href=#>Beck Bennett</a>, Nick Rutherford and Editor Dave McCary, in which Mooney often did celebrity impersonations. The group found a bit of success which would later open the doors for Mooney to become a part of “Saturday Night Live”. His net worth would increase thanks to this opportunity, and soon his “Good Neighbor” colleagues would also be hired by “Saturday Night Live”. Mooney was only one of two debuting players who were re-engaged, and were later upgraded to repertory status. Some of Mooney’s most popular YouTube characters have been brought to SNL, including his person-on-the-street interviews. Some of his other popular characters include Chris Fitzpatrick, Bruce Chandling, and the 420 weed smoking guy.</p><p>Since becoming a part of “SNL”, Kyle has received numerous film opportunities which have raised his net worth further. He was a part of 2016’s “Zoolander 2”, and “Neighbors 2: Sorority Rising”. He also wrote and acted in the film “Brigsby Bear”. Kyle has made guest appearances too, in popular shows such as “Parks and Recreation”, “Drunk History” and “Hot Package”. He’s also been featured as a part of “<a href=#>Jimmy Kimmel</a> Live!” and “Sports Show with <a href=#>Norm Macdonald</a>”, all steadily adding to his net worth.</p><p>For his personal life, not much is known about Mooney’s romantic relationships, although he is reputed to be dating “SNL” colleague Leslie Jones. Mooney is near sighted and left handed. He owns a VHS collection which he started working on since he was a child – thanks to his connections, he was able to get VHS tapes autographed by actors. He owns a “Beetlejuice” VHS which is signed by <a href=#>Alec Baldwin</a> and <a href=#>Michael Keaton</a>. He’s also active on social media, having over 100,000 followers on Twitter, and over 200,000 on Instagram. All of his pages are updated regularly with comedy content and daily endeavors.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=13.953857791225><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Kyle Mooney</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$600,000</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>September 4, 1984</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>San Diego, California USA</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>1.71 m</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Comedian</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Education</td><td>University of Southern California</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Parents</td><td>Linda Kozub, Brian Mooney</td></tr><tr><td>Siblings</td><td>Sean Mooney, Ryan Mooney</td></tr><tr readability=0.37837837837838><td>Twitter</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://twitter.com/kylemooney</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.39130434782609><td>Instagram</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://www.instagram.com/kylemooney/</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.20512820512821><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3324982/</a></td></tr><tr readability=16><td>Movies</td><td>Brigsby Bear, Neighbors 2: Sorority Rising, Zoolander 2, It Had To Be You, The Party Is Over, Hello, My Name Is Doris, Hello Ladies: The Movie, Hello Ladies, Kill Me Now, Sorority Pillow Fight, Saturday Night Live, Never Goin' Back</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>TV Shows</td><td>Hello Ladies, Saturday Night Live</td></tr></table><h3 class=toggle-head>Actor <span class="fa fa-angle-down" aria-hidden=true></span></h3><table class=actor readability=11.5><tr><th>Title</th><th>Year</th><th>Status</th><th>Character</th></tr><tr readability=2><td>Saturday Night Live</td><td>2013-2017</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Various / Bruce Chandling / MC Strategy / ...</td></tr><tr><td>Brigsby Bear</td><td>2017</td><td></td><td>James Pope</td></tr><tr><td>Drunk History</td><td>2016</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Sam Patch</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Zoolander No. 2: French Toast Dresses and Other Lame Sh**T</td><td>2016</td><td>Video short</td><td>Don Atari</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Neighbors 2: Sorority Rising</td><td>2016</td><td></td><td>R.A.</td></tr><tr><td>Zoolander 2</td><td>2016</td><td></td><td>Don Atari</td></tr><tr><td>It Had to Be You</td><td>2015</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Me Him Her</td><td>2015</td><td></td><td>Hoot Morezit</td></tr><tr><td>The Party Is Over</td><td>2015</td><td></td><td>Natan</td></tr><tr><td>Hello, My Name Is Doris</td><td>2015</td><td></td><td>Niles</td></tr><tr><td>Hello Ladies</td><td>2013-2014</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Rory</td></tr><tr><td>Playing It Cool</td><td>2014</td><td></td><td>Other Dude</td></tr><tr><td>Comedy Bang!
