She was interested in art from a young age and started acting in community plays with her sister. They both played Anna and Elsa in the play Frozen Jr. No matter what, their parents do not hesitate to support their girls on social media, no matter how large or tiny their successes are; they are always there to show their love and admiration. The couple has continually pushed both daughters to pursue their aspirations.</p><p>Marlow began her career acting as a theatrical performer.
