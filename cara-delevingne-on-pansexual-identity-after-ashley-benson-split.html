I’m attracted to the person.”</p><p>The Carnival Row actress later added that she “never thought” she needed to come out. In 2017, she shared <a href=#>with Glamour magazine</a> that when she revealed she was sexually fluid, people thought that meant she was gay.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Cara-Delevingne-Opens-Up-About-Her-Pansexual-Identity-After-Ashley-Benson-Split-2.jpg><p>“I’m like, ‘No, I’m not gay,'” she said at the time to the magazine. “A lot of the friends I have who are straight have such an old way of thinking. It’s ‘So you’re just gay, right?’ [They] don’t understand it. [If] I’m like, ‘Oh, I really like this guy,’ [they’re like], ‘But you’re gay.’ … Someone is in a relationship with a girl one minute, or a boy is in a relationship with a boy, I don’t want them to be pigeonholed.”</p><p>In 2016, while in a relationship with <strong>St. Vincent</strong>, the singer <a href=#>revealed to Vogue magazine</a> that she never understood the depth of love and her identity until then. “As a child, I used gay as a bad world, as in, ‘that’s so gay.’ All my friends did,” she said at the time. “If people want to say I’m gay, that’s great. But we’re all liquid — we change, we grow.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Cara-Delevingne-Opens-Up-About-Her-Pansexual-Identity-After-Ashley-Benson-Split.jpg><p>Delevingne, who also previously dated actress <a href=#><strong>Michelle Rodriguez</strong></a>, was in a relationship with <a href=#><strong>Ashley Benson</strong></a> for <a href=#>the last two years</a>. Us Weekly <a href=#>confirmed they called it quits</a> in early May. The <a href=#>Pretty Little Liars</a> alum, 30, has since moved on with <a href=#><strong>G-Eazy</strong></a>. When she started getting messages of hate <a href=#>about moving on</a>, Delevingne came to her defense.</p><p>“It’s more <a href=#>important now than ever to spread love, not hate</a>,” the Suicide Squad star wrote via Instagram Stories on May 14. “To everyone hating on @ashleybenson please stop. You don’t know the truth, only her and I do and that’s exactly how it should be.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGacmaKWeqWxy56toqaXo7Juu81mp5qmo5rFtq3LZqCdnZ6ptrXFjJqdrZ2iYq60tMuesGaalaPAsLqMrKeloaRk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-ocz-vertex-3-review-120gb.html><span>←</span><span>AnandTech Storage Bench 2010 - The OCZ Vertex 3 Review (120GB)</span></a>
