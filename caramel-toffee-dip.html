Whip the softened cream cheese in a bowl with brown sugar and vanilla extract until smooth and light and fluffy.</li><li><strong>Spread into a bowl or small square dish</strong>. I suggest a 6 x 6 or 7.5 x 6 dish.</li><li><strong>Cover with caramel sauce</strong>. Sprinkle with chopped Heath Bar toffee bits.</li><li><strong>Cut the chilled apples into slices</strong>. If you are going to serve at a party, I suggest sprinkling the sliced apples with lemon juice or fruit fresh to keep the apples from oxidizing and turning brown. You can mix fresh lemon juice with water to dilute the tart lemon flavor.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Dip the apples into the caramel toffee dip</strong>. I suggest placing a small cheese knife nearby to make it easy to scoop up.</li><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Caramel-Toffee-Dip-5-720x930.jpg alt="A 5-ingredient Caramel Apple Dip made with cream cheese, brown sugar, vanilla, caramel sauce, and Heath Bar toffee pieces.

You don’t want to use caramel syrup as it would be too runny. You want it to be nice and thick. I love to use the caramel sauce from Trader Joe’s. If you have a Kroger brand store nearby, such as Fry’s, Smith’s, and Ralph’s, I like their Private Selection caramel sauce.</p><p><strong>What type of dish should I use?</strong></p><p>This is such a versatile sweet dip as you can put in a bowl, place it on a plate, or place it into a smaller casserole dish or platter. You just need to spread on the cream cheese mixture, drizzle it with caramel, and sprinkle on toffee bits. The sliced apples can go on the platter or on another plate.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Caramel-Toffee-Dip-6-720x691.jpg alt width=720 height=691 sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h3>How to store Caramel Toffee Dip:</h3><p>I suggest keeping the caramel dip stored in the refrigerator. Place in a container and cover it tightly. It can remain in the refrigerator for 7-10 days.</p><p>I suggest slicing the apples right before you are ready to serve the caramel apple dip.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Caramel-Toffee-Dip-4-720x686.jpg alt="A 5-ingredient Caramel Apple Dip made with cream cheese, brown sugar, vanilla, caramel sauce, and Heath Bar toffee pieces.
