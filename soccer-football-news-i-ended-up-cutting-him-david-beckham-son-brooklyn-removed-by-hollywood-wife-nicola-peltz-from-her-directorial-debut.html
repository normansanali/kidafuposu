She has starred in several movies and drama series such as The Last Airbender, Transformers: Age of Extinction, Bates Motel, and many more. After achieving a significant amount of success as an actress, the Hollywood star prepared to dip her feet into the directing world. In 2021, an official announcement read that Peltz would be directing Lola James along with Bria Vinaite.</p><p>However, startling news has just emerged from the sets of Lola James in recent days. Peltz has removed her own husband, Brooklyn Beckham from the final cut of her movie.</p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9>Why did Nicola Peltz remove Brooklyn Beckham from Lola James?</h2><p>The film universe was thoroughly surprised after hearing the news. The movie, Lola James is mainly about a 19-year-old girl called Lola. As per the storyline, the teenager goes through various struggles to save her younger brother from a toxic environment at home. Along the journey, she will also face a phase of drug addiction alongside another mysterious event.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Nicola Peltz and Bria Vinaite set to co-direct indie feature drama LOLA JAMES. This is Peltz and Vinaite's feature debut as directors. Peltz is also debuting as a writer.</p><p>The story follows a 19-year old Lola working to save enough money to save her brother from a toxic home. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/tUOzCdbPml</a></p><p>— Screen Queens (@screenqueenz) <a href=#>March 22, 2021</a></p><p>Brooklyn Beckham was extremely eager to get a role in the movie. The crew began filming for the movie in 2021 and Brooklyn was part of the original plans. However, he could not be seen in the final cut of the movie at all. The American actress then revealed that she had cut his scenes out of the entire movie. Peltz claimed that her husband’s acting skills were not appropriate to the task.</p><p>While explaining the situation, she said, “I started laughing so hard. He had the most British accent ever. I ended up cutting him out! He sat there, in the editing room, he was like, ‘Did you really just cut me out while I’m sitting here?’. I was like, ‘Yes, I love you so much!”,&nbsp;<a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>as per The Things.</a></p><p>Apart from Peltz’s movie, the celebrity couple has been in the limelight for an infamous lawsuit related to their wedding.</p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9>David Beckham embarrassed by son’s wedding controversy</h2><p>Brooklyn Beckham and Nicola Peltz tied the knot on April 9, 2022. It was a lavish wedding reception in Palm Beach, Florida. However, the fans only got to know the sour truth behind the lavish celebration after a few days. Nicola Peltz’s father had originally hired Bragin and Grijalba to organize the wedding. However, the wedding planners could not handle the never-ending guest list.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Nicola Peltz wore Valentino Haute Couture to marry Brooklyn Beckham at her family home in Palm Beach, Florida.

But the wedding planner duo has refused to return the money. Peltz’s father then filed a lawsuit against the wedding planners. In return, the planners filed a counterclaim and both parties are refusing to back out. Brooklyn’s wedding saga has gone on for longer than expected while leaving David Beckham ‘horrified’ and ‘embarrassed’.</p><p><strong>WATCH THIS STORY:</strong>&nbsp;<strong><a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Power couple David Beckham vs Victoria Beckham net worth comparison 2022: Who’s wealthier?</a></strong></p><p>What do you think about the Nicola Peltz cutting her husband’s scenes from the final cut of Lola James?
