Neal McDonough comes from a&nbsp;non-show-business family.</h2></p><p>His father met his mother when he&nbsp;worked at&nbsp;the local Ford plant. He&nbsp;subsequently went into real estate and purchased a&nbsp;little hotel on&nbsp;Cape Cod, where Neal grew&nbsp;up. Neal’s father instilled in&nbsp;him an&nbsp;honorable work ethic and told him, If&nbsp;you work hard, you will achieve enormous success.</p><p>As&nbsp;the youngest of&nbsp;6&nbsp;children, it&nbsp;was always a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>joy for him</a> o&nbsp;make his older siblings laugh. He&nbsp;said, “I&nbsp;was the school’s prankster and the center of&nbsp;attention.” Because of&nbsp;his dyslexia, he&nbsp;was terrible at&nbsp;math and reading, but he&nbsp;was fantastic at&nbsp;making others laugh.</p><p><h2>2. How it&nbsp;all started: Neal’s journey to&nbsp;becoming an&nbsp;actor</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/d5d/75e/5a8ef855fdae53b0a6376708ed.png><p>Lionel Guericolas/MPP/Starface/STARFACE PHOTO /East News</p><p>He&nbsp;went to&nbsp;Barnstable High School and graduated. He&nbsp;then went to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Syracuse University</a>, where he&nbsp;joined the Sigma Chi fraternity and got his Bachelor of&nbsp;Fine Arts degree in&nbsp;1988. He&nbsp;was offered a&nbsp;huge scholarship to&nbsp;play baseball in&nbsp;college, but he&nbsp;chose to&nbsp;go&nbsp;for acting.</p><p>He&nbsp;won the Best Actor Dramalogue award in&nbsp;1991 for his role in&nbsp;<i>Away Alone.</i> His first movie <i>Darkman</i> aired in&nbsp;1990, with the success of&nbsp;many&nbsp;TV shows and movies like <i>Boomtown, Star Trek: First Contact, Minority Report, Walking Tall, </i>and <i>The Hitcher.</i></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/372/43a/65777356fb9ff4f876e7a52f59.jpg><p>Moreover, he&nbsp;received positive feedback on&nbsp;his famous character, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>villain Damien Darhk</a>, from the series <i>Arrow</i> where he&nbsp;played a&nbsp;character who had mystical powers, but reflects how really he’s a&nbsp;good person in&nbsp;real life.</p><p>In&nbsp;addition, before meeting his wife he&nbsp;intended to&nbsp;end his <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Hollywood career</a>, he&nbsp;revealed. He&nbsp;planned to&nbsp;return to&nbsp;Cape Cod, work at&nbsp;his parents’ motel, and participate in&nbsp;community theater. Then he&nbsp;received a&nbsp;call from Steven Spielberg requesting an&nbsp;audition for <i>Band of&nbsp;Brothers</i>, and it&nbsp;was game&nbsp;on.</p><p><h2>3. Neal McDonough and Ruvé Robertson met in&nbsp;2000.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/f2e/7b8/4e2b9757d4be378ab7475a3ac7.png><p>In&nbsp;2000, when Neal was making <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Band of&nbsp;Brothers</i></a>, the 2&nbsp;lovers met by&nbsp;accident. He&nbsp;says that he&nbsp;fell in&nbsp;love with his wife, Ruvé, the first time he&nbsp;saw her. Additionally, he&nbsp;says that they ran into each other on&nbsp;St. Patrick’s Day during an&nbsp;interview in&nbsp;2004.</p><p>In&nbsp;the same way, he&nbsp;claimed that the first time he&nbsp;saw her, he&nbsp;accidentally commented, “You’re tall.” At&nbsp;the time they met, he&nbsp;was already seeing someone else when he&nbsp;called his then-girlfriend and told her, “I’m sorry, but it’s not going to&nbsp;work out between&nbsp;us anymore. I&nbsp;just met the woman I’m going to&nbsp;marry.”</p><p><h2>4. In&nbsp;2003, the McDonough’s got hitched.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/b6a/f6f/a5491e561e825a596854ee51d8.jpeg><p>Ruvé and Neal <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>got married</a> on&nbsp;December&nbsp;1, 2003, 3&nbsp;years after they first met. Their wedding was beautiful, and their honeymoon was a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;fun. It&nbsp;took place in&nbsp;Cape Cod, London, South Africa, Santa Barbara, and other places for 7&nbsp;weeks.</p><p>He&nbsp;still shows how much he&nbsp;loves his wife through his Instagram posts. On&nbsp;their <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>13th wedding</a> anniversary, he&nbsp;posted a&nbsp;lovely message saying that he&nbsp;had married his best friend, love, and life partner. He&nbsp;expressed gratitude again for the best thing that could ever happen to&nbsp;a&nbsp;man.</p><p>The McDonoughs have marked 19&nbsp;years of&nbsp;<a href=# title=marriage data-link=tag>marriage</a> thus far, and are still going on&nbsp;with their wonderful life with 2&nbsp;boys and 3&nbsp;girls.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/e7c/3db/2b72e6584d95855dcf7b8ac6fe.jpeg><p>Of&nbsp;those 2&nbsp;boys and 3&nbsp;girls, their first child was, Morgan Patrick McDonough, then they had their second child, Catherine Maggie McDonough. After a&nbsp;couple of&nbsp;years, their third child was born, a&nbsp;daughter named London Jane McDonough.</p><p>Then came Clover Elizabeth McDonough, and later the couple’s youngest child, James Hamilton McDonough, was welcomed into the family. So, the family of&nbsp;7, who are based in&nbsp;LA, lead a&nbsp;happy life together.</p><p><h2>5. After they got married, Neal McDonough refused to&nbsp;participate in&nbsp;kissing scenes for movies and series.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f18/948/c77342598cbe818e5d7f211e1a.jpg><p>So, on&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>his</a> way to&nbsp;becomingan&nbsp;actor, he&nbsp;made it&nbsp;clear that his faith comes first. In&nbsp;fact, he&nbsp;has never done any unsuitable scenes in&nbsp;his entire 30-year career. Even after being married for as&nbsp;long as&nbsp;they have, the father of&nbsp;5&nbsp;still loves his wife more than anyone else. He&nbsp;said, “I&nbsp;won’t kiss any other woman because these lips are only for one woman.”</p><p>Some people in&nbsp;Hollywood have been willing to&nbsp;respect his beliefs, like when he&nbsp;got a&nbsp;part on&nbsp;a&nbsp;show that had a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;inappropriate content: “When Marc Cherry signed&nbsp;me, I&nbsp;told him, ’You probably already know this, but&nbsp;I won’t kiss anyone.’” He&nbsp;remembered telling the show’s creator that he&nbsp;was a&nbsp;Christian, “’But this is&nbsp;<i>Desperate Housewives</i>!’ Cherry said. I&nbsp;told him, ’I know.’ He&nbsp;waited about 5&nbsp;seconds and then said, ’Okay, I’ll just have to&nbsp;write better.’”</p><p><h2>6. He&nbsp;got fired from <i>Scoundrels </i>for refusing to&nbsp;touch anyone’s lips other than his wife’s.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/1b8/5b2/532aae5bd7858d330c5da72d45.jpg><p>VALERY HACHE/AFP/East News</p><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>McDonough</a> said that his policy of&nbsp;“no&nbsp;love scenes” cost him a&nbsp;role on&nbsp;the ABC show <i>Scoundrels</i> in&nbsp;2010. He&nbsp;declared “no” to&nbsp;doing racy scenes with actress Virginia Madsen because he&nbsp;was loyal to&nbsp;his wife. People say that this move cost him $1&nbsp;million.</p><p>He&nbsp;was shocked, and it&nbsp;was a&nbsp;terrible situation for him. After that, nobody would hire him because he&nbsp;wouldn’t agree to&nbsp;participate in&nbsp;these types of&nbsp;scenes. He&nbsp;commented, “I&nbsp;have a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;faith.”</p><p><h2>7. Neal and his family got through the storm because they chose to&nbsp;count on&nbsp;their confidence instead trying to&nbsp;change the world.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/699/612/d68a2d5a8aac46b7f1d9ef33a4.jpeg><p>He&nbsp;knew he’d made the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>right decision</a> by&nbsp;believing in&nbsp;himself and his wife, the woman he&nbsp;fell in&nbsp;love with at&nbsp;first sight. He&nbsp;said, “I’m the luckiest guy&nbsp;I know to&nbsp;have her as&nbsp;my&nbsp;partner in&nbsp;everything after 5&nbsp;kids and a&nbsp;really great life.”</p><p>Neal may have had some hard times, but since then, his career has been phenomenal. His face is&nbsp;well-known, even if&nbsp;not everyone knows his name.</p><p>What do&nbsp;you think about how involved Neal McDonough is&nbsp;with his family?
