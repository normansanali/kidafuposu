Assembled and operated by Ray Billings, Tombstone, unfortunately, did not return because of its owner's injuries.</p><p>In a post that Ray Billings made in the Battlebots <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Facebook group</a>, he said, "I've been public about my hand injury, but haven't really gone into too many details or specifics. But the damage to my hand was fairly significant."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Ray went on to explain that he likely had one more surgery to go after recently undergoing his third procedure. Although he was fairly confident that he'd regain his hand mobility through physical therapy, he revealed that his surgeries and the Battlebots shooting schedules conflicted, and he ultimately needed to prioritize his health over the show.</p><p>He continued, "Right now I have to focus on healing and not risk further injuries trying to "push it" now."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who competed in the World Championship VII?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>World Championship IV semi-finalist Death Roll was the first robot to be accepted into the competition, his entry was announced by Battlebots co-founder Greg Munson in September 2022.</p><p>Besides Death Roll, a total of 50 robots from all around the world were invited to compete at Caesars Entertainment Studios in Las Vegas, Nevada.
