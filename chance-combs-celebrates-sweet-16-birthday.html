The teen received loving messages from her father, Sean “Diddy” Combs, and other loved ones who also took to social media to celebrate her day.</p><p>“HAPPY SWEET 16 TO MY ANGEL @myfancychance,” Diddy wrote to <a href=# rel=noopener>his daughter</a>. “I love you so much,” the celebrity father said. “I thank GOD every day for you. You make me the proudest Father!”</p><p>Chance Combs is Diddy’s daughter with Sarah Chapman.

Chance received loads of love from her sisters, D’Lila and Jessie, who joined others at Chance’s birthday bash.</p><p>“HAPPY BIRTHDAY CHANCEYYYYY,” Jessie and D’Lila wrote online. The teens also shared a clip from their sister’s birthday party. “We love you sooooo, sooo much,” The Combs twins shared. “You are the best sister anyone could ever ask for,” Jessie and D’Lilah told Chance.</p><p>Diddy agreed about Chance being an absolute delight. “You’re the most amazing person and I can’t wait to watch you continue to grow and see all the great things you will go on to do,” the celebrity father wrote to his teen. “I LOVE YOU, I LOVE YOU, I LOVE YOU,” Sean Combs <a href=# rel=noopener>exclaimed</a>.</p><p>Chance and her sisters have been getting into the groove of fashion ever since their successful showing at the Dolce and Gabbana fashion show last year. “Words can’t explain,” Diddy said after the show in Italy convened. “Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful,” supermodel Naomi Campbell said of the Combs sisters’ delivery on the catwalk. “So graceful,” Campbell continued. “Proud aunty.”</p><p>Chance and her sisters expressed a desire to continue to <a href=# rel=noopener>pursue modeling</a> in the coming months. Many fans certainly agree that the girls have the “it” factor needed to make a statement on the runway.
