They say if the shoe fits, wear it. But what they forgot to mention is if the shoe hurts, definitely don’t wear it! And one of the most common sources of heel pain is plantar fasciitis. This condition involves inflammation of the band of tissue running alongside the sole of your foot, the plantar fascia. Because this ligament connects your heel bone to the base of your toes, it supports the arch of your foot and absorbs shock as you walk. Through routine activities over time, the fascia can become irritated after losing some of its resilience. The next thing you know, even getting out of bed in the morning can feel like torture. In fact, the condition is well-known to flare up in the mornings!</p><p>Plantar fasciitis is so common, in fact, that <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">approximately two million people receive treatment each year</a>. If you’re experiencing discomfort from this condition, just know that you’re not alone. Many runners have suffered from plantar fasciitis at least once in their lifetime, and it can pop up in any shopper’s life when they least expect it. Sometimes, it’s accidentally self-inflicted!</p><p>According to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">John Hopkins Medicine</a>, America’s first research university, the type of shoes you’re wearing can trigger plantar fasciitis. Some of the worst culprits? Flip-flops, flats, stilettos and old shoes. That’s why experts recommend replacing your sneakers every six months. We need to keep our toes to be in tip-top shape to avoid injury. Fresh footwear means better cushioning and support.</p><h2><strong>How We Chose the Best Shoes for Plantar Fasciitis</strong></h2><p>So, now that we know the problem, what’s the solution? Glad you asked. Well, for starters, we recommend seeking professional advice from a doctor or physical therapist to target your individual needs. Every foot is different! That being said, one form of plantar fasciitis treatment is switching to shoes with better arch support or trying orthotics that will cushion the heel. In other words, it’s time to go shoe shopping! Music to every woman’s ears.</p><p>We selected the 16 best shoes for plantar fasciitis, focusing on a few key factors: support, comfort/cushioning, style and fit. We took reviews heavily into account as well! From sneakers to sandals, these shoes will put a spring in your step! We’re head over heels (pun intended) for this fascia-friendly footwear!</p><h2><strong>1.
