The group, who call themselves “The Missing Project”, have admitted to making both videos and have apologized for their actions. They have also revealed that the hoax video was also scripted and staged, and that the victim in both videos is actually one of their friends, who agreed to participate in both pranks.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Why did they make the hoax video?</h2><p>The group behind both videos have explained that they made the hoax video as a way of continuing their prank and testing their skills in filmmaking and editing even further. They have also claimed that they wanted to make fun of the people who believed the original video and the people who doubted it. They have said that they did not intend to harm or offend anyone, and that they regret their decision to upload both videos online.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How did they make the hoax video?</h2><p>The group have shared some details about how they made the hoax video, which involved using the same props, makeup, and special effects as the original video. They have said that they used a fake knife, fake blood, and a voice changer to create the illusion of a violent and realistic scene in the original video. They have also said that they used a software program to blur the victim’s face and add a grainy and shaky effect to both videos. They have stated that they spent several hours filming and editing both videos, and that they were inspired by some horror movies and video games.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What are the consequences of the hoax video?</h2><p>The hoax video has caused even more controversy and backlash online, as many people have criticized the group for their irresponsible and insensitive behavior.
