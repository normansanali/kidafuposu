Among the names to have given it the old college try are legendary producer Joel Silver, the disgraced Bryan Singer, Top Gun: Maverick‘s Joseph Kosinski, Drive‘s Nicolas Winding Refn, and 47 Ronin‘s Carl Rinsch.</p><p data-characters=385 data-current-count=753 data-injectable=true>If you thought we were done, we haven’t even mentioned Ex Machina‘s Alex Garland, Mission: Impossible‘s Christopher McQuarrie, or the many other writers, directors, and filmmakers who tried and failed to get a new spin on Logan’s Run off the ground. Ironically, Michael Bay probably came closest, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">even if nobody would admit where The Island got its inspiration</a>.</p><p data-characters=368 data-current-count=368 data-injectable=false>On the plus side, audiences are still keen to check out the original, with Michael York’s title hero going undercover to try and stop a revolution before becoming its key instigator in the far-flung future of 2274 currently flying high as one of the most-watched features on iTunes, per <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">FlixPatrol</a>.
