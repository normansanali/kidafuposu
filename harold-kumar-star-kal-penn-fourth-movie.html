The original, Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle, was released in 2004 and became a cult classic. This was the height of the DVD era, so it makes sense why it did so well. Just imagine all of the dorm rooms that had a copy of this movie.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=326 data-current-count=326 data-injectable=false>That success spawned the 2008 sequel Harold & Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay, which, you guessed it, revolves around the pair escaping from prison. A third movie, A Very Harold & Kumar 3D Christmas then came three years later at the height of the 3D craze. These films certainly know how to capitalize on trends, eh?</p><p data-characters=270 data-current-count=596 data-injectable=true>Now, nearly a decade has past and Penn thinks it’s time for another hit off of that bong. While speaking with Variety, he said that both he and Cho have discussed doing another one and he’s also spoken with the creators, Jon Hurwitz and Hayden Schlossberg, about it.</p><p>“We would love to do a fourth movie. John Cho and I text about it all the time,” said Penn. “Jon Hurwitz and Hayden Schlossberg — who created and wrote all three movies in the franchise — we all would love to do one. I think we all, thankfully, have the blessing of being really busy right now and want to find the right venue and the right timing.”</p><p data-characters=0 data-current-count=0 data-injectable=false><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/157685691752434879-2020-03-11T235849.996.jpeg alt="Harold & Kumar" width=1113 height=576 sizes="(max-width: 1113px) 100vw, 1113px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p data-characters=404 data-current-count=404 data-injectable=true>Of course, what makes the original so good is that all it’s about is two roommates longing for some fast food to ease their daily troubles. That’s it. It’s simple, hilarious and features a phenomenal (and comeback) performance from Neil Patrick Harris. The sequel, meanwhile, became a little too political, but it still has its merits. And honestly, I’ve never managed to see the third movie.</p><p data-characters=369 data-current-count=369 data-injectable=false>Comedies are easy to make, though. They’re cheap and as a result, can turn a profit much faster. But based on the track record of some recent sequels to dormant comedy franchises (Dumb and Dumber To, Zoolander 2, and Super Troopers 2), a fourth Harold & Kumar doesn’t guarantee success, which means it might have to happen on a streaming platform at this point.</p><p data-characters=112 data-current-count=481 data-injectable=false>What do you think, though? Could a <strong>Harold & Kumar</strong> movie even work today? Sound off below with your thoughts.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJon5qqn6GxbrfUppirZaOprrN5ypqjZqiVo7tuss6uqa2gXaK8t7XEaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./gary-abernathy-biography-wikipedia-and-net-worth-everything-to-know-about-the-journalist.html><span>←</span><span>Gary Abernathy Biography, Wikipedia and Net Worth: Everything To Know About the Journalist</span></a>
