Along with former R.E.M. bandmate <a href=#>Peter Buck</a>, he's been involved with The Baseball Project, which formed around 2007. According to <a href=#>WBUR</a>, the band also boasts members of fellow college radio sweethearts the Dream Syndicate and the Young Fresh Fellows, and features Josh Kantor, renowned organist at Fenway Park. As you've probably guessed, the alt-rock supergroup's focus is baseball, writing songs about the game's players and related stories. They even sang the national anthem at a game between the Red Sox and Yankees in 2012 (available&nbsp;on <a href=#>YouTube</a>). They recently dropped a gorgeous-but-melancholy&nbsp;<a href=#>new song</a> in honor of&nbsp;<a href=#>Lou Gehrig</a>&nbsp;and suggested their long-awaited fourth album might be forthcoming.</p><p dir=ltr>Last November, Mills got involved with get-out-the-vote initiatives and literacy campaigns for the state of Georgia (per <a href=#>REMHQ</a>). Earlier this year, he took part in a star-studded jam, which benefited the St. Jude's Children's Research Hospital, per <a href=#>The Warburton</a>. Also, via&nbsp;<a href=#>REMHQ</a>, he played bass for Split Single, and the album will be out later this month (hear their new single on <a href=#>YouTube</a>). According to <a href=#>Consequence of Sound</a>, Mills also managed to squeeze in a Zoom appearance commemorating the 25th anniversary of "Weird Al" Yankovic's "Bad Hair Day" album, on which one of Mills' songs was parodied.</p><p dir=ltr>On a more personal note, Mills celebrated his <a href=#>62nd birthday</a> last December, and according to his official <a href=#>Instagram</a>, he got engaged to a lovely lady named Jasmine. Congratulations to them both!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunCAk2tqam1frLWmvsRmoKxlnZ64pnnMoqOlq12bv7C5jKtknmWdYsGwsMCyZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./tijl-de-decker-obituary-tragic-loss-of-u23-paris-roubaix-winner-cyclist-in-training-crash.html><span>←</span><span>Tijl De Decker Obituary: Tragic Loss of U23 Paris-Roubaix winner Cyclist in Training Crash</span></a>
