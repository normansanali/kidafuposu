The clip began with a screenshot of a phone’s blurry lock screen with the words, “Why are you always checking the time?” As the background became clear, a photo of the sonogram was revealed and the message, “What time?” appeared on the screen.</p><p>“The best is yet to come. Can’t wait to meet you little love,” they captioned the post. “Baby Manzo coming September 2024.”</p><p>After Albie, 37, and DeMonaco’s announcement, his mother, <strong>Caroline Manzo</strong>, celebrated her expanding family in a post via <a href=# rel=noopener>Instagram</a> on Monday. “As we count our blessings, today we add one more. We can’t wait to meet you, our little cinnamon bun.
