The rule was amended at the start of the show in 2003 to allow the players to continue playing as long as they used to win. Following the implementation of this rule, Tom Walsh established the first set record, attending nearly eight consecutive games and winning approximately $186,900. It was held prior to Jennings’ round of the game. Ken resigns from Jeopardy on November 30, 2004, after losing the 75th game to another individual named Nancy Zerg. He lost a total of approximately $10,200 and was left with $14,400 at the end of the round. He could not perform invincibly before reaching the game’s final round.</p><p>Only Jennings and Zerg finished with double Jeopardy and a positive score of $10,000, allowing them to play the final Jeopardy round. Ken’s losing episode can be seen on the 2005 DVD edition of Jeopardy. Prior to Jennings’ role, players were given a limited amount of practice time, but more practice time was eventually added to the rehearsal time so that players could become acquainted with the buzzer system. At the same time, the person in charge of the buzzer system was replaced. On December 1, 2004, the day after Ken Jennings’ defeat, Ken made a special appearance during the host Alex Trebek’s acknowledgment of Ken Jennings’ consecutive success and summary of the many games shows that he had won previously throughout his tenure in the game Jeopardy.</p><h2><span id=Body_Measurements_Height_Weight_Hair_color>Body Measurements: Height, Weight, Hair color</span></h2><table style="width:80%;margin:0 auto"><tbody><tr><td>Height</td><td>in feet inches&nbsp;<strong>– 5’ 10”</strong>&nbsp;– in Centimeters&nbsp;<strong>– 178 cm</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td>in Kilograms&nbsp;<strong>– 70 kg</strong>&nbsp; –&nbsp; in Pounds&nbsp;<strong>–&nbsp; 154</strong>&nbsp;<strong>lbs</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Shoe Size</td><td>10 (U.S.)</td></tr><tr><td>Hair Color</td><td>Light Brown</td></tr><tr><td>Eye Color</td><td>Green</td></tr><tr><td>Body Type</td><td>Slim</td></tr></tbody></table><h2><span id=Social_Media_Details>Social Media Details</span></h2><p>Ken Jennings does not have an official presence on social media platforms such as Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, and TikTok.</p><h2><span id=Trivia>Trivia</span></h2><ul><li>Ken was previously employed as a software engineer in 2004 when he received a phone call informing him that his candidate audition had been successful and that he would be on the game show Jeopardy later that year in June.</li><li>He does not consume alcohol, tobacco, or narcotics.</li><li>His appearance was extended beyond a single game.
