And those eagle-eyed fans might have also noticed a few similarities between her real-life fairytale wedding and her on-screen ceremonies. <strong>Let's take a closer look…</strong></p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">Don't miss...</h4><p id=eOQLrcmRor3 data-wc=27>Michelle's on-screen persona first married in the premiere episode of series three of&nbsp;Downton when <strong>Lady Mary and Matthew Crawley got hitched in a beautiful church ceremony.</strong></p><p id=e5FPHkURzu5 data-wc=55>Much like in real life, her on-screen father, Robert Crawley, was a proud father of the bride, as was her other Downton&nbsp;father figure Mr Carson (Jim Carter). Both Hugh and Jim, and Jim's actress wife Imelda Staunton, were in attendance at Michelle and Jasper's wedding looking elated for their close friend and former colleague.</p><p id=ezMDyfmkV5_9 data-wc=14><strong>MORE:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Joanne Froggatt is a classic beauty in waist-cinching dress after confirming new romance</a></p><p id=eEjNHrqZ8l data-wc=15><strong>MORE:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Why Downton Abbey star Michelle Dockery's wedding would have been bittersweet for Allen Leech</a><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/44b1208e4f1b-michelle-dockery-wedding.jpg><h2>Michelle Dockery's bridesmaids</h2><p id=eWZ7Lb5Jj5v data-wc=49>Another wonderful similarity was Michelle's bridesmaids. Downton fans would have been delighted to see <a class=hm-link href=#>Michelle's co-star, Laura Carmicheal</a>, take on the role of Bridesmaid at the church ceremony over the weekend. Laura looked stunning as she wore a sage green silk dress and carried a beautiful bouquet of flowers.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/0dc4bf164190-spl9937844144.jpg><p id=eb873Xa_Nbs data-wc=39>It's no surprise that Laura, who played Lady Edith, and Michelle have built a strong friendship after playing sisters on the show. In both of Mary's on-screen weddings, Lady Edith had an important role in her sister's special day.</p><h2>The finer details</h2><p id=eXLo5xOdkOF data-wc=66>Fans might have spotted from photos of Michelle and Jasper's special day that Michelle was holding a white bag adorned with pearls on the strap. A bride can never go wrong with pearls on her wedding day, and Lady Mary wore a string of gorgeous pearls on her<strong>&nbsp;second wedding to Henry Talbot, played by Matthew Goode</strong>, following the tragic death of Matthew Crawley (Dan Stevens).</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/1767d6cc7c41-michelle-dockery-downton.png><p id=eg8no3qogHW data-wc=44>Although the blushing bride had her hair down in loose waves for her big day, her on-screen persona sported updos on both of her TV weddings. Mary's hair was a classic 1940s chic style, in theme with the time period of the drama series.</p><p id=eJOk4f32HPQ data-wc=32>In both her real-life wedding and on-screen weddings, however, Michelle's make-up was the perfect natural finish. She kept her eye make-up simple and her lip colour was a pale pink – gorgeous!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/ed0c16d772bc-downtonabbey.jpg><h2>Michelle and Jasper say 'I do'</h2><p id=el7hGhbcjvq data-wc=49>Keeping with wedding traditions, the bride and groom walked out of the church after saying 'I do' while their friends, family and other guests threw flower petals over the grinning couple. In Mary's weddings to both Matthew and Henry, their guests do the same, celebrating Lady Mary's special day.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/ac24f3669da9-gettyimages-1393642740.jpg><p id=eBmtB_RDSOi data-wc=73>Meanwhile, Michelle and Jasper are yet to speak out about their nuptials last week, but are no doubt enjoying wedded bliss after becoming husband and wife. They shared the news of their engagement in The Times. The announcement read: "The engagement is announced between Jasper, son of Michael Waller-Bridge of King's Lynn, Norfolk, and Teresa Waller-Bridge of Battersea, London, and Michelle Dockery, younger daughter of Michael and Lorraine Dockery of Gidea Park, Essex."</p><p id=e75BPhWH03z data-wc=23>The couple are believed to have met through friends in 2019 and made their first public appearance together at the Rome Film Festival.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfl7%2BqsMSsZm5oY2mFcnvMopqhnZyhsm6wzpyinqqpYsSmsNJmmGakn6S4brXNrKCdnV2dsrN5w6iup6yfo3qirsGesGavlZmxqrrGrGY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jalen-hurd-net-worth-2024.html><span>←</span><span>Jalen Hurd Net Worth 2024</span></a>
