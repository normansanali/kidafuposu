<span>Martina Birk</span></p><h1>Beth Mowins Biography, Is She Married Husband or Lesbian?</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><span>Aside from being the first of many things for women in sports coverage, Beth Mowins is best known for her work as a sports commentator and speaking directly as a sportswriter for ESPN and CBS.&nbsp;Her career chronicle began in 1991 and has been very busy with her many moves on different networks, getting the best recommendations for a higher move for each.</span></p><p><span>Her hard work from the start got a good head in 2005, when the spotlight rose to make history as only the second woman on ESPN to nationally televise college football games.&nbsp;As a commentator, Beth has had the pleasure and honor of working with the best hands at work, such as Cat Whitehill, a retired US soccer professional defenseman and former assistant coach for the Boston Breakers in the NWSL at ESPN Third Broadcast crew for the FIFA Women’s World Cup 2011 TV broadcasts.</span></p><h2><strong><b><span>Beth Mowin’s Biography (Age)</span></b></strong></h2><p><span>Beth Mowins was born on May 26, 1967 in Syracuse, New York as the only sister of 3 brothers.&nbsp;The Mowins family is known for having a flair for sports.&nbsp;While her father worked as a basketball coach, her mother followed ice hockey very closely.&nbsp;Out of a love of sports, which came from both parents, the family watched different sports all the time and maybe that ignited the light of sports in Beth.</span></p><p><span>At a very young age of around 9 or 10, BethMowins knew she had a future in sports after seeing female sports announcers and commentators.&nbsp;While attending high school in North Syracuse, New York, Beth Mowins showed an interest in sports such as basketball, softball, and soccer.&nbsp;For two seasons while still in high school, she enjoyed the perks of being the captain of the varsity basketball team.&nbsp;And as important as sport was to Mowins, she continued her education to earn a bachelor’s degree from Lafayette College in 1989.&nbsp;She later earned a master’s degree from Syracuse University.</span></p><p><span>Mowins began her career as a newscaster and sportswoman in 1991 as director of WXHC-FM radio in Homer, New York.&nbsp;In 1994 she joined ESPN and in 2009 Mowins became part of the Greater Syracuse Sports Hall of Fame.&nbsp;In 2017, she was the play-by-play announcer for ESPN’s opening week for Monday Night Football, which aired late between the Los Angeles Chargers and Denver Broncos.&nbsp;In doing so, Beth Mowins made history by becoming the first woman to name a nationally televised NFL game.&nbsp;Because of this, Mowins also made another story by becoming the second female play-by-play announcer in the NFL regular season after Gayle Sierens did the same job for NBC Sports in 1987.</span></p><span>Mowins appeared to be enjoying the story she had made, and her career and development continued when, in 2017, she became the first female play-by-play announcer for the NFL on CBS to break a curse again in its 58-year history.&nbsp;She named the season Cleveland Browns and Indianapolis Colts matchup with Jay Feely in 2017.</span><p><span>During her career, Mowins quit for several games – both the ones mentioned above and many others.&nbsp;This only added to her numerous accomplishments, increased her fame and made her smile to the bench more often.&nbsp;In 2018, Mowins called out the Jets against the Lions game in Detroit.&nbsp;As a sports reporter, she also challenges NCAA softball to ESPN, making her one of the most important ESPN triple headers of the Saturday season, along with many other jobs.</span></p><h2><strong><b><span>Is she married to a husband or is she a lesbian?</span></b></strong></h2><p><span>Beth Mowins has managed to keep her private life away from the eyes of many.&nbsp;For a number of years, Mowins has been accused of being gay mainly because of her voice, which many claim often sounds like a man’s.&nbsp;With all the claims people have been making about Mowin’s sexuality, there was nothing she could have believed, as Beth has chosen to remain silent on any non-career-related discussions.</span></p><p><span>More so, despite her age, the legendary media personality does not have a husband, as she has never been married.&nbsp;This is one of the reasons why some people keep speculating about their sexual orientation.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Wealth (income and earnings)</span></strong></h2><p><span>Beth Mowins has been successful in her career for many years.&nbsp;Because of this, she has been named as one of the highest paid sports commentators.&nbsp;Just like many things remain unknown about Mowin’s personal life, she also has her net worth, but there is no doubt that having worked many good years, she earns well and lives a good life.</span></p><h3 class=main-box-title>You may also like</h3><p class=postsid
