We’re talking. We’re eating dinner, we’re going out for drinks. So, who knows? Do I want to be back together again?

This was evident as they chose to stay in “different hotel rooms” while attending the dinner.</p><p id=eXRN8R416ov data-wc=48>Jax, however, hinted at the uncertainty of the evening, quipping about the potential outcomes dependent on their indulgences: “Depends on how much I have to drink tonight, we’ll see who goes to what room,” he said playfully. “Well, it depends on how much she has to drink, actually.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/e0a5eecfe8e0-www-instagram-com-p-cosq97dvek-77419833d0fcb4-1.jpg><p id=eUqOtbaBv0A data-wc=35>The couple, who separated in February after nearly five years of marriage, still managed to present a united front at a White House brunch earlier that day, posing together and separately on the red carpet.</p><p id=exH43-JPQrp data-wc=73>Since their split, Jax and Brittany have openly shared the challenges that strained their relationship, including disagreements over money and intimacy. Brittany recently revealed on "VPR" that financial dynamics shifted when she began earning more, impacting Jax's ego. “I know whenever me and Jax were going through that where I was making more money for once, I could tell that was a shift for him,” she disclosed, indicating how it “hurt Jax’s ego.”</p><p id=eCfVcT1YVAt data-wc=27>Moreover, intimacy issues also surfaced as Brittany admitted on their reality show that their physical relationship had dwindled, only having been intimate "twice in the past year."&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/60b47db60770-www-instagram-com-p-csxrz43pf3b-774198365cbd25.jpg><p id=eDff5SK4qo2 data-wc=35>Jax echoed this sentiment in a confessional, lamenting, “The romantic spark is just not there right now. … Your sex life and your marriage kind of take a back seat when you have a child.”</p><p id=eHdz5w4Fk29 data-wc=33>Together, they continue to navigate their complex situation, balancing personal growth with their commitments to their son and their shared business ventures, including their sports bar and newly launched reality show, The Valley.</p><p id=elFZ2rOUXs2 data-wc=32><strong></strong></p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
