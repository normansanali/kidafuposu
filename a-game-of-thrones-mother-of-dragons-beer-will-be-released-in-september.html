A Mother of Dragons beer, which is set to be released on September 28, might just do the trick.</p><p>The drink, which honors beloved GOT character Daenerys Targaryen (played by <a href=#><strong>Emilia Clarke</strong></a>), is part of <a href=#>Brewery Ommegang</a>’s most recent Royal Reserve Collection, and is the third of four libations to be released as part of this group. Like the Royal Reserve Collection drinks before it, the Mother of Dragons beer is “designed and brewed as an homage to one of four epic figures engaged in the battle for the Seven Kingdoms.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/game-of-thrones-beer.jpg><p>More specifically, Brewery Ommegang notes this Daenerys-centric refreshment, which is a blend of a smoked porter and a Belgian kriek, represents the “smoke and fire that Daenerys has unleashed on her opponents during her ascent to conquer and rule the Seven Kingdoms.”</p><p>Furthermore, the Mother of Dragons beer has aromas of chocolate-covered cherries intertwined with subtle smoke and roasted malt, and a rich flavor that includes notes of tart cherry and semi-sweet chocolate with a semi-dry finish.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“Mother of Dragons represents, in beer, one of our favorite characters from Game of Thrones,” Brewery Ommegang president Doug Campbell said in a <a href=#>press release</a>. “Daenerys’s ascent from obscurity has been one of the most inspiring storylines of the show, and we’re thrilled to release a blend that embodies the character traits that have underpinned that rise.”</p><p>The Mother of Dragons drink joins other Royal Reserve Collection beers including Hand of the Queen, a barleywine that was released in April in honor of Tyrion Lannister (played by <a href=#><strong>Peter Dinklage</strong></a>) and Queen of the Seven Kingdoms, a sour blonde blend inspired by <strong><a href=#>Lena Headey</a></strong>’s Cersei Lannister that debuted in June. The fourth and final beer in this collection – Ommegang’s 13th Game of Thrones beer overall – is expected to be announced later this year.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmn6efmXyvsdasZppll5a6pnnOn2StoKKku6a%2FjKamraCVp3qwsoydqZqfn6PAbq7Enqlmr5mhuW6uxGapnqSVlsCmsIyipWarlaXBprnBnqlo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./mummies.html><span>←</span><span>9 Mummies And The Fascinating Stories Behind Them</span></a>
