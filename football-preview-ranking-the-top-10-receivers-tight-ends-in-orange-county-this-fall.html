Tetairoa McMillan, Servite:</strong> His speed, size (6-4, 185), jumping ability, sure hands and overall athleticism make McMillan a matchup challenge for even the best cornerbacks in Southern California. During this past spring’s football season, McMillan was at his best in Servite’s biggest games. He had six receptions for 107 yards and a 32-yard touchdown catch against Mater Dei. McMillan, All-Trinity League first team last season and All-CIF in volleyball, selected Arizona, Oregon and USC as his finalists from a long list of college scholarship offers.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i1.wp.com/wpdash.medianewsgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/OCR-L-HSFB-BOSCO-0327.dk_.05.jpg><p><strong>2. CJ Williams, Mater Dei:</strong> He was All-Trinity League first team this past season as a junior. Williams (6-2, 195), who has sprinter speed and quick-cutting skills, had 16 receptions for 239 yards and five touchdowns in five games, including three catches for 55 yards and two touchdowns in a 34-17 win over St. John Bosco. His lengthy list of scholarship offers includes Alabama, Notre Dame, Ohio State, Texas and USC.</p><p><strong>3. Braden Pegan, San Juan Hills:</strong> Pegan is (6-4, 200 and has “freakishly big hands,” according to Stallions coach Robert Frith. This past spring Pegan had 24 receptions for 426 yards and three touchdowns over five games. He might not have county-leading statistics this season – with co-receivers Elijah Barclay and Cole Monach on the roster, passes will go to a variety of targets – but he was highly-prized by college programs before his commitment to UCLA.</p><p><strong>4. Keyan Burnett, Servite:</strong> He has the size (6-5, 215) and hands that make him one of the most coveted tight ends in the nation. Burnett’s speed, though, allows the Friars to move him around in their offensive formations. Every college that thought it had a chance at Burnett made him an offer; he chose Arizona.</p><p><strong>5. Mikey Matthews, Mission Viejo:</strong> Matthews (5-10, 180) was a South Coast League co-offensive MVP last season, a rare honor for a sophomore. This past spring he had 34 receptions for 470 yards with eight touchdowns. Matthews and fellow junior Jackson Holman will be one of the better receiver duos in county football.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2.wp.com/wpdash.medianewsgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/OCR-L-HSFB-LOSAL.14-1.jpg><p><strong>6. Makai Lemon, Los Alamitos:</strong> He was the Sunset League co-MVP this past spring season with Griffins quarterback Malachi Nelson. Lemon (5-11, 175) last season had 43 receptions for 756 yards and nine touchdowns in six games. His large list of college scholarship offers includes Alabama, Oklahoma and USC.</p><p><strong>7. Deandre Moore, Los Alamitos:</strong> Moore (5-11, 190) is, according to Coach Ray Fenton, “just like Makai,” and that’s double-trouble for opposing teams. Moore, a junior, transferred to Los Alamitos from Las Vegas’ Desert Pines High, which did not play during the 2020-21 school year because of the COVID-19 pandemic. That did not quell college recruiting interest. Moore has offers from Alabama, Arizona, Arizona State and Auburn … and those are just the schools that start with “A.”</p><p><strong>8. Elijah Barclay, San Juan Hills:</strong> He started his high school football life at Mater Dei, and when COVID-19 pushed back the start of the 2020 season Barclay moved to Tucson and played his junior year at Salpointe High. Barclay (6-2, 180), who has scholarship offers from several colleges including Arizona, Nebraska and Purdue, had 15 catches for 332 yards and six touchdowns over four games at Salpointe. “He is electric-fast and can absolutely stretch the field for us,” said San Juan Hills coach Robert Frith.</p><p><strong>9. Jordan Ross, Pacifica:</strong> Ross (6-0, 170) had 16 receptions for 292 yards and four touchdowns over four games as a freshman last season. He was All-Empire League first team. He’s also an outstanding cornerback. Ross has a scholarship offer from Notre Dame.</p><p><strong>10. Kashton Henjum, Newport Harbor:</strong> He was Sunset League receiver of the year last season as a sophomore. Henjum (6-2, 185) had 53 catches for more than 700 yards over the Sailors’ six games. “He can go up and get it,” Newport Harbor coach Peter Lofthouse said, “and has great leaping ability and incredible hands.”</p><p><strong>RELATED</strong></p><p><a href=#>• Ranking the top running backs in Orange County this fall</a></p><p><a href=#>• Ranking the top quarterbacks in Orange County this fall</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href=#>This post first appeared on ocregister.com</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue82erqxnlqS8ta7ApaNmqKKaw6qx1mapmqabnruoedOhnGasn6V6cnyMq5ycnZmrsrO%2FjK2goKCkYrKvsNJmoKdln6eur7PEZpqorZ6pxm7Ax6KqZp6Roblw</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./glen-powell-sydney-sweeney-flirting-rom-com-timeline-html.html><span>←</span><span>Every Time Glen Powell and Sydney Sweeney Promoted Their Rom-com a Little Too Well</span></a>
