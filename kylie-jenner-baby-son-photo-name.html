But a couple of weeks later she said they would be changing his name because “it didn’t feel like him.”</p><p>Since then, fans have been wondering about Kylie Jenner’s son and his new name. Father’s Day was no exception for fans demanding for the couple to reveal his name and his face.</p><p>“Girl, post a photo of the baby’s face,” a fan wrote. Another fan followed” “We need to see his little face 😩🤍.“</p><p>A third one commented in capital letters: “Say the name.“</p><p>An upset fan asked: “Why are u still covering the babies face and name?
