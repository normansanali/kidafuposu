What an idiot," the man says again as he exits the store with his wife.</p><p>The TikToker writes in a caption for the video: "he didn't give us a chance to show our receipt, when he just instantly grabs our cart and pushes it into my husband, so yes I got in front because our daughter who's disabled is in the cart while he's grabbing our cart left and right, my kids were also scared.
