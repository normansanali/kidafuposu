She is a social media star, singer and a YouTuber, who is known best for being a member of the family Eh Bee, which was very active on the now-defunct network Vine and is today active on YouTube and various social media networks. The family is living in Ontario.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=early-life-family-and-education></span>Early life, family and education<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Gabriela is being raised alongside her brother Roberto Burgos, or ‘Mr. Monkey’, by their father Andres Burgos or ‘Papa Bee’ and their mother Rossana Burgos or ‘Mama Bee’ – the family became active on the internet in January 2013, and Gabriela’s parents are also models and businessmen, as they’ve signed contracts with various companies and brands including Johnson & Johnson, Toyota, and Pepsi.</p><p>Gabriela became interested in sports while attending elementary school, and thanks to her parents’ activities on the internet, she became interested in singing and dancing.</p><p>After noticing that she’s talented, her mother enrolled her at a singing school, while Gabriela has also been practicing her acting skills with her school’s drama club.</p><p>She has just recently in 2020 enrolled at a high school, and although she has four more years to go before matriculation, Gabriela has already expressed her desire to attend college.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=career-as-a-social-media-star></span>Career as a social media star<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>As the family has described in the bio section of their YouTube channel, their main goal is for parents to watch their videos and learn how to have fun with their children and other halves.</p><p>Their channel, “The Bee Family” was launched on 21 June 2013, and has since gathered well over nine million subscribers, and over 2.5 billion views of all their videos combined.
