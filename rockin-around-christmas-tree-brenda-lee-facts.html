And I did."</p><p class=paragraph-text>And her iconic, raspy voice has echoed throughout the ages when it's played each Christmas.</p><h2 class=heading-subtitle><strong>When was ‘Rockin’ Around The Christmas Tree’ originally released?</strong></h2><figure>The original single cover for 'Rockin' Around The Christmas Tree'. <span class=attribution>Picture: Decca Records</span></figure><p class=paragraph-text>'Rockin' Around The Christmas Tree' was first released in 1958, but didn't make a dent in the charts that year or the next.</p><p class=paragraph-text>In 1960 however, Brenda Lee scored a few hits and was slowly becoming a recognised star so the song caught on and went to No.14 in the US.</p><p class=paragraph-text>It charted again in 1961 and 1962, and continued to sell well during subsequent holiday seasons, peaking as high as No. 3 on Billboard's Christmas Singles chart in December 1965.</p><p class=paragraph-text>Lee said, "It was magic, and I think we all knew it. It took a few years to take off, but once it did, it really did."</p><p class=paragraph-text>As we know went on to become a Christmas all-time classic, and Brenda Lee's version has gone on to sell over 25 million copies worldwide.</p><h2 class=heading-subtitle><strong>Who else has recorded ‘Rockin’ Around The Christmas Tree’?</strong></h2><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.ytimg.com/vi/9zteitQOhxQ/hqdefault.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>Rockin' Around The Christmas Tree</p><p class=paragraph-text>It's more of a question of who hasn’t recorded ‘Rockin’ Around The Christmas Tree’..</p><p class=paragraph-text>The likes of <a href=#>Cyndi Lauper</a>, LeAnn Rimes, <a href=#>Miley Cyrus</a>, <a href=#>Justin Bieber</a>, <a href=#>Carrie Underwood</a>, <a href=#>The Osmonds</a>, <a href=#>Stella Parton</a>, Kim Wilde, <a href=#>John Travolta</a> and <a href=#>Olivia Newton-John</a>, <a href=#>Kelly Clarkson</a>, and even The Wurzels have given it a go.</p><h2 class=heading-subtitle><strong>Which films has ‘Rockin’ Around The Christmas Tree’ famously appeared in?</strong></h2><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.ytimg.com/vi/4YzdSpwNs30/hqdefault.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>Home Alone 2, Party Scene</p><p class=paragraph-text>Undoubtedly the most famous use of Brenda Lee's 'Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree' is in Home Alone as Macauley Culkin's character Kevin hosts a fake party to confuse the thieves attempting to break into his house after his parents leave him behind for their annual Christmas holiday.</p><p class=paragraph-text>The track is used frequently in films&nbsp;set around Christmas and has also appeared in Last Christmas, Jingle All the Way, Cheaper by the Dozen, Reindeer Games, Enemy of the State, and The Long Kiss Goodnight.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tLnOqKuhqpGZtrB6wqikaJ6VlsG2vsSsZq2glWLAtbvRsmSonl%2BnvKS3yKdkmqqfqrulecKhqaKrpKKutHnTq5yeZZKnsq%2BwwGajnp1dm66kwNJo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./tech.html><span>←</span><span>Tech Archives Page 3 of 15 We Got This Covered</span></a>
