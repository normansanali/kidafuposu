These Games were very popular as they were the first Hunger Games, but were not televised.</p><p>In this manner, Why is The Hunger Games a banned book?</p><p>The Hunger Games is a well loved dystopian YA novel, following the story of Katniss Everdeen. … The Hunger Games has been “<b>banned due to insensitivity, offensive language, anti-family, anti-ethic, and occult</b>”, and in 2014 “inserted religious views” was added to that list.</p><p>Keeping this in view, Why did Annie Cresta go crazy?</p><p>Annie <b>suffered from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)</b> due to her traumatic experiences in the Hunger Games. Katniss Everdeen described her as ‘strange’ but stated that she was not mad, as most others believed, simply unstable and seemed to like Annie since they kept in touch after the war was over.</p><p>Furthermore, Who was the youngest person to win the Hunger Games?</p><p>During the 65th Hunger Games, <b>Finnick</b> was mentored by a previous District 4 victor, Mags Flanagan (winner of the 11th Hunger Games), and won the competition at age 14, making him the youngest victor in the history of the games.</p><p>Who killed seeder?</p><p>During the Games, she is killed by <b>Marian</b>, from District 9, and places 22nd out of 24. Later, Katniss sees her death portrait portrayed in the sky.</p><p>Secondly, Is Hunger Games ok for 11 year old?</p><p>The book is rated by Scholastic as grade 5.3 and <b>for ages 11-13</b>. Parents’ concerns about The Hunger Games center around violence. … The book has a powerful anti-violence and anti-war message. And unlike cartoons and video games, the violence in Hunger Games has emotional and physical consequences.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Is_The_Hunger_Games_a_true_story></span><strong>Is The Hunger Games a true story?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>No, <b>The Hunger Games is not based on a true story</b>, though its themes are quite relevant and applicable to real life.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Where_is_Harry_Potter_banned></span><strong>Where is Harry Potter banned?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Islam. The Harry Potter books were banned in <b>schools across the United Arab Emirates (UAE)</b> in 2007. According to a spokesman from the education ministry of the UAE government, the books’ fantasy and magic elements were contrary to Islamic values.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_is_the_name_of_Katniss%E2%80%99s_daughter></span><strong>What is the name of Katniss’s daughter?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>There are even claims that Suzanne Collins later admitted she named them <b>Willow and Rye</b>. The closest I could come to confirming that information is Entertainment Weekly including the trivia in one of their Mockingjay quizzes.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Did_Finnick_know_Annie_was_pregnant></span><strong>Did Finnick know Annie was pregnant?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Finnick, for his part, <b>never knew that Annie was pregnant in the first place</b>, and all we see of the boy is when Annie sends Katniss and Peeta a picture of their son, and they put it in their memory book.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_does_Gale_end_up_with></span><strong>Who does Gale end up with?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>In the Mockingjay movie, Katniss confronts Gale about his role in Prim’s death, which he struggles to come to terms with. Katniss, unable to look at him the same way, lets him walk away without a word and eventually ended up living with <b>Peeta</b>.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Why_did_Katniss_drown_Buttercup></span><strong>Why did Katniss drown Buttercup?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Katniss tried to drown Buttercup <b>because she didn’t think he would be able to survive</b>. A scrawny kitten with half an ear and a squashed nose, Buttercup didn’t seem to have what it took to survive in the harsh world inhabited by Katniss and her family.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Why_did_wiress_go_crazy></span><strong>Why did wiress go crazy?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>The blood rain started and they were all unable to see and talk. Then Blight ran into the forcefield and was killed. <b>When the bloodrain ended</b>, Wiress became mentally unstable and all she could say was “tick, tock”, hinting that the arena was a clock.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Did_President_Snow_win_the_Hunger_Games></span><strong>Did President Snow win the Hunger Games?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>She later used one of the snakes as a hidden weapon to kill another tribute, before going on to <b>win the Hunger Games</b>. Snow was ecstatic, as her victory seemingly also brought him the Plinth Prize, a newly created award which would pay for all of his tuition to the University.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_kills_Brutus_in_The_Hunger_Games></span><strong>Who kills Brutus in The Hunger Games?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p><b>Peeta</b>, in a fit of rage, kills Brutus seconds later (which he reveals in Mockingjay.). Brutus placed 7th and was the last tribute to die. Shortly after his death, Katniss destroyed the arena and ended the Games, leaving six surviving tributes.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Should_I_let_my_11_year_old_read_Twilight></span><strong>Should I let my 11 year old read Twilight?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>First, it depends on the maturity of the child for Twilight and New Moon. I would say <b>as young as 10 for</b> those kids. Eclipse is still fine for anyone over the age of 12, but Breaking Dawn is for a more young adult audience, like 14-15 in my opinion. But it all has to do with the child’s maturity.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Is_The_Hunger_Games_movie_inappropriate></span><strong>Is The Hunger Games movie inappropriate?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Hunger Games has a <b>PG-13 rating</b>, despite the clearly violent nature of the story. We’re not just talking about teenagers seeing the movie. According to research, parents of 12% of 10- to 14-year-olds let them see R-rated violent movies.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Was_Katniss_really_pregnant></span><strong>Was Katniss really pregnant?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Biography. During the interviews for the 75th Hunger Games, Peeta lied about Katniss being pregnant to try to protect her from the Games, and Katniss later stated that she <b>miscarried</b> due to an electric shock in the arena to avoid further questioning.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Is_The_Hunger_Games_set_on_Earth></span><strong>Is The Hunger Games set on Earth?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>The series takes place in the <b>fictional nation of Panem</b>, which was created at an unspecified time in the future after a series of ecological disasters and a devastating war.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_did_America_become_Panem></span><strong>How did America become Panem?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Some time after the end of the world as we knew it, a nation was established in <b>North America by people who had survived the collapse of modern civilization that would</b> soon come to be known as Panem. … A map of Panem superimposed over a map of present-day North America.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Why_was_Harry_Potter%E2%80%99s_scream_muted></span><strong>Why was Harry Potter’s scream muted?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Then poor Harry’s scream is muted–apparently <b>because Daniel Radcliffe gave a scream so raw and visceral</b>, they didn’t feel comfortable putting it in the film.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Why_was_Harry_Potter_banned_in_the_US></span><strong>Why was Harry Potter banned in the US?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>“The curses and spells used in the books are actual curses and spells, which when read by a human being risk conjuring evil spirits into the presence of the person reading the text,” Reehil added.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Why_was_Alice_in_Wonderland_banned></span><strong>Why was Alice in Wonderland banned?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>China bans book for ‘insult’ to humans</p><p>Alice in Wonderland was banned in China’s Hunan province by the Governor as far back as 1931. The primary reason for the ban was <b>because the censor general believed attribution of animals acting like humans with the same complexity was an “insult”</b>.</p><h3><strong></strong></h3><h3><strong></strong></h3><p>Last Updated: 16 days ago – Authors : 17 – Contributors : 14 – References : 18 interviews and posts; 7 Videos.</p><p>Discover all about your fav. celebs at <a href=# rel=noopener>Celebrity Interviews</a> and don’t forget to share this post !</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbBnnp1kxKm7jLCmp2WknbJufdKtZKGtnpyys3nGmqSeq18%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-iq-is-gifted.html><span>←</span><span>What IQ is gifted?</span></a>
