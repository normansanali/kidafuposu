Macbeth, Pride, and The Two Faces of January are among his many credits.</p><p>Recent productions with Margot include the ice-skating drama I, Tonya, in which his wife plays disgraced figure-skater Tonya Harding, the thriller Terminal, and the Oscar-winning feature Promising Young Woman.</p><p>He and Margot are also working on Tank Girl and Barbie film adaptations. What if they combined the two? Anarchy in film form.</p><h2>Do they have children together?</h2><p>Robbie and Ackerley do not have any children of their own at this time.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmJa7orLUqGWcp51kuqK%2BxqirZqqfl6%2BqsYyhrKyakaOxbrnEnqtmrJ%2BieqKvyp6ppZ2pZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kofi-siriboe-wife-girlfriend-duckie-thot-parents-brothers.html><span>←</span><span>Kofi Siriboe Wife, Girlfriend, Duckie Thot, Parents, Brothers, Net Worth</span></a>
