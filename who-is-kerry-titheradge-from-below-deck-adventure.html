<span>Aldo Pusey</span></p><h1>Who Is Kerry Titheradge From Below Deck Adventure?</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>The first season of Bravo’s Below Deck Adventure will premiere next week. The program is the latest installment in the network Below Deck series. The crew members of the motor yacht Mercury will be featured in the next reality TV series, and the captain of the boat is Kerry Titheradge. Only time will tell if he can win hearts as the previous captains from the Below Deck series showed. Captain Kerry’s profile on Bravo states that he has almost 30 years of experience working on boats, including nearly two decades aboard yachts. On Below Deck Adventure 2022, he will be in charge of eight crew members.</p><h2>Captain Kerry Titheradge owns and operates his own sailing company.</h2><p>Kerry Titheradge is the CEO and owner of Yachting Concepts, as well as the skipper of the boat Mercury. The company offers yacht delivery and management, crew services and management, and skipper services.</p><p>On Bravo, his bio reads:</p><p>“Capt. Kerry Titheradge is ready to cruise the Nordic waters, having sailed in the Mediterranean, Caribbean, Pacific Northwest, and other destinations.” Capt. Kerry is a disciplined and fair leader with almost 30 years of experience working on boats and nearly two decades in yachting.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Kerry-Titheradge-1.jpg alt="Kerry Titheradge" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>It goes on:</p><p>“When he isn’t in the cockpit, Capt. Kerry spends time with his children in Palm Beach Gardens, Fla.” This season, his leadership is tested as a crew member turns disobedient early on, forcing him to relearn to trust his squad.”</p><p>Captain Kerry is originally from Townsville, Australia, but now resides in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida. He has two children, a boy, and a daughter, and is now engaged to a lady whose identity he has not disclosed. She is, nevertheless, visible in the majority of Kerry’s Instagram postings, particularly those with his children. The captain’s profile on his company’s website emphasized the difficulties he had in his early life. Kerry was born in Brisbane, Australia, to a construction worker father and a hairdresser mother. Because of his father’s profession, the family traveled from city to city until he was 18 years old.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Kerry-Titheradge-2.jpg alt="Kerry Titheradge" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Kerry began doing low-wage jobs at the age of 16, but he discovered his passion as a deckhand on a parasailing boat. He has been unstoppable since then, accumulating over 30 years of expertise in the maritime sector. His résumé also mentions “outdoor adventure activities” and “off-road escapades,” making him an ideal candidate for Bravo’s Below Deck Adventure.</p><h2>When will the first season of Below Deck Adventure premiere on Bravo?</h2><p>Season 1 of Below Deck Adventure will premiere on Bravo on Tuesday, November 1, 2022 at 9.00 p.m. ET. Captain Kerry will command the yacht Mercury, which will be crewed by eight people: chef Jessica Condy, chief stew Faye Clarke, stews Oriana Schneps and Kasie Faddah, bosun Lewis Lupton, and deckhands Kyle Dickard, Michael Gilman, and Nathan Morely.</p><p>Below Deck Adventure season 1’s official summary is as follows:</p><p>“In the newest installment of the Emmy Award-nominated series, Bravo takes viewers beyond the deck and off the yacht as guests paraglide, explore caverns, and enjoy adventurous helicopter flights over the Norwegian Fjords.”</p><p>Captain Kerry just made his BravoCon debut as a Below Deck member. Sandy Yawn (Below Deck Mediterranean), Lee Rosbach (Below Deck), Jason Chambers (Below Deck Down Under), and Glenn Shephard (Below Deck) joined him (Below Deck Sailing Yacht). Meanwhile, new episodes of Below Deck Adventure 2022 (season 1) will run on Bravo every Tuesday at 9:00 p.m. ET.</p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Below Deck Adventure</a> <a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Kerry Titheradge</a></span><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiuoaddnsBut8SrqbJlpJ7BqbHRmpugnV2bv7C5jJucpaenYrGmr8pmmJ2ulaPBtr7EaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./whiskey-wine-fire-festival-makes-stop-charlotte-this-weekend.html><span>←</span><span>Whiskey, Wine &amp;amp; Fire Festival makes stop in Charlotte this weekend WSOC TV</span></a>
