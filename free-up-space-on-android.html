This is where you can see how much space your Android phone or tablet has left and what's using up the most space. Some devices also include some helpful tools for cleaning.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How to See Which Android Apps Are Taking Up the Most Space</a></span></p><p>On a Samsung Galaxy device, you'll need to go to Settings > Battery & Device Care > Storage.

Samsung actually points out files you could delete to make more room, including "Duplicate Files" and "Large Files." It's a good idea to regularly check out the "Storage" section to clear out junk.</p><h2 id=free-up-space-with-google-files>Free Up Space With Google Files</h2><p>"Files by Google" comes preinstalled on some Android phones. If it's not on yours, you can&nbsp;<a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">download it from the Play Store</a>. One feature that makes it extra useful is the ability to automatically identify things that can be removed from your phone to free up storage space.</p><p>Open Files by Google and switch over to the "Clean" tab at the bottom.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/2023-01-19_14-02-33.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The first thing you'll notice is a progress bar of how much storage space you've used. Underneath, Google has automatically suggested files you can delete to free up storage space. Common examples are screenshots, duplicate files, and photos that are already backed up to Google Photos.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/2023-01-19_14-04-45.png><p>The "Junk Files" category is for temporary files, like cached files for apps.

Files by Google is a handy app to have for keeping tabs on your storage usage.</p><h2 id=how-to-delete-downloads-on-android>How to Delete Downloads on Android</h2><p>Downloads can add up quickly over time. Whether it's ringtones, memes from Facebook, photos to send friends, or PDFs for work, there's a lot of stuff that ends up in the "Downloads" folder on your Android device.</p><p>The Downloads folder can be found in the File Manager app of your choosing. On Samsung Galaxy devices, the app is simply called "My Files." Google Pixel devices come with Files by Google preinstalled.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Screenshot_20230119-142146_My-Files.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Once you've found the "Downloads" folder, it's just a matter of selecting the files you'd like to delete and tapping the trash button.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/2023-01-19_14-25-16.jpg><p>The Downloads folder can easily get filled with stuff you don't need anymore.

However, you can go in and manually remove the files whenever you want.</p><h2 id=uninstall-unused-apps>Uninstall Unused Apps</h2><p>Unsurprisingly, apps take up a lot of space on your Android device too. App files themselves take up space, plus they accrue extra files during installation and after being used over time.
