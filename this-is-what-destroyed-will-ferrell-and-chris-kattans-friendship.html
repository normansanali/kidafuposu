And in the memoir, per <a href=#>Page Six</a>,&nbsp;Kattan claimed that Lorne Michaels coerced him to have sex with director Amy Heckerling, allegedly so she would stay on as a director of the film. (A spokesperson for "Saturday Night Live" denied the accusation to Page Six, and Heckerling only served as the producer while John Fortenberry directed.)</p><p>Kattan claimed he initially rebuffed Heckerling's advances, but ultimately relented so she would stay on with the film.&nbsp;"I had tried to hide my relationship with Amy, not realizing how obvious it had been to everyone else, including Will (not to mention that Lorne told him about it in the first place)," Kattan wrote. He also said he tried calling Will Ferrell several times after shooting wrapped, but didn't speak to Ferrell again until they both arrived at NBC Studios for Season 23 of "Saturday Night Live."&nbsp;"I don't want to be your friend anymore. I'm going to be professional and still work with you on the show, but that's it," the comedian reportedly said to Kattan.</p><p>Shortly after Kattan went public with the accusation, Heckerling's daughter responded.
