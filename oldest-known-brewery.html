Instead, it’s currently believed that the beverage was an essential part of royal rituals and sacrificial rites. Indeed, the ancient necropolis in which this brewery was found was a vital hub in the kingdom.</p><p>Abydos was once a busy and stunning honorary site to Osiris, ancient Egypt’s god of the underworld and the judge of incoming souls to the afterlife. The site is riddled with remnants of Osiris-centric statues, cemeteries, as well as the ancient temples of pharaohs Rameses II and Seti I.</p><p>According to one of the excavation’s leaders, Dr. Matthew Adams of New York University, this particular brewery “may have been built in this place specifically to supply the royal rituals that were taking place inside the funeral facilities of the kings of Egypt.”</p><p>While it is still uncertain how exactly Egypt’s earliest kings used the substance, it is believed that beer was actually a source of nourishment to many in the ancient kingdom. <a href=# rel=noopener>According to</a> Business Insider, laborers in Egypt were rationed 10 pints a beer a day for food.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-316736 alt="Clay Beer Factory Basins" width=900 height=506 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/clay-beer-factory-basins.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-316736 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Egypt Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities</span><span class=caption-body>The factory held 40 clay basins across eight large sections —&nbsp;each of which was around 65 feet long and eight feet wide.</span></p><p>Located in the modern-day Sohag Governorate, the brewery was comprised of eight large sections, each of which contained 40 clay pots that were used to heat up the necessary mixtures of water and grain. By the looks of it, Adams said this setup could’ve produced as many as 5,900 gallons of beer — or 50,000 pints — at one time.</p><p>Each section was also about 65 feet long and eight feet wide. The 40 pottery basins, meanwhile, were resourcefully lined in two rows,&nbsp;presumably to provide the brewers with easy and efficient access instead of clumping them all together.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-316739 alt="City Plan Of Abydos" width=900 height=561 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/city-plan-of-abydos.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-316739 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><span class=caption-body>A city plan of Abydos, as detailed by French Egyptologist Auguste Mariette — who founded the country’s Department of Antiquities.</span></p><p>While the announcement of this historic find is certainly invigorating, the state of Egypt’s economy and tourism is another matter.
