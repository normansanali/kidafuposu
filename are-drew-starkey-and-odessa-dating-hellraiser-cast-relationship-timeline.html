Many people assume they are dating since they are frequently spotted together. So, Odessa and Drew Starkey are a couple? Let’s investigate.</strong></p><p>If you have seen the David Bruckner-directed 2022 horror/mystery/thriller film Hellraiser, you surely recall the principal stars Drew Starkey and Odessa A’zion. The two young people are excellent performers who have a lot more to give the entertainment business.</p><p>While Odessa appears to be concentrating on her acting roles for this year, Drew is now starring in the Outer Banks television series. Additionally, Drew and Odessa appear to have a good relationship and to have grown close on set and in real life. As a consequence, a lot of people think they are dating and are curious about the history of their relationship. In the article that follows, let’s find out if the two actors are now dating or not.</p><h2><span id=Are_Odessa_and_Drew_Starkey_a_couple>Are Odessa and Drew Starkey a couple?</span></h2><p>Even at an early age, Odessa and Drew are both accomplished in their own fields. Additionally, their attractiveness does not harm us. Given that they are successful and attractive, it is only reasonable for followers to assume that they are seeing or dating someone. Starkey and A’zion, however, choose to keep their personal connections under wraps as is common for performers.</p><p>It is difficult to determine who the Hellraiser cast is dating right now since they have done a good job of hiding their romantic relationships. However, due to their lovely relationship and frequent public appearances together, many people believe that Odessa and Drew have recently started dating.</p><p>On Drew’s birthday in November 2022, Odessa also shared some nice photos of the two of them, but it appears that they are close friends. Additionally, it was more clear for followers to think that they were dating because of the cute and intimate photos Odessa uploaded of the pair.</p><p>However, neither party has publicly acknowledged or denied their relationship, and they appear to be more like friends than lovers. Furthermore, their relationship has not been established by any reliable authorities. Odessa and Drew don’t appear to be dating, so.</p><h2><span id=Timeline_of_Cast_Relationships_in_Hellraiser>Timeline of Cast Relationships in Hellraiser</span></h2><p>As was previously established, Starkey and A’zion have both contributed to the film Hellraiser. The film is a remake of the 1987 horror classic by Clive Barker, in which a young woman struggling with addiction buys a mysterious puzzle box but is unaware that its purpose is to summon the Cenobites. Despite appearing in the same film together, as was already revealed, the two are not dating.</p><p>Therefore, nothing is known about the progression of their relationship or how they originally met or became friends. In the upcoming days, perhaps, we will discover more about the connection they have.</p><h2><span id=Examining_the_Net_Worth_of_Drew_Starkey_and_Odessa_A8217zion_in_2023>Examining the Net Worth of Drew Starkey and Odessa A’zion in 2023</span></h2><p>While the specific amount is unclear, some sources estimate Drew Starkey’s net worth to be between $300,000 and $750,000.His net worth has skyrocketed as a result of his on-screen appearances and several corporate partnerships.</p><p>Odessa A’zion, on the other hand, has a net worth that The Wiki Feed pegs at $1 million.
