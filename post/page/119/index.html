Hannah was one of the wives of Elkanah, who loved her dearly but had no children with her. His other wife, Peninnah, had many children and enjoyed gloating over her rival. Hannah prayed to God for a son and promised that should she be so blessed, she would give her son over to the Lord.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Why does King Charles III have swollen fingers?</h2><time>Aug 2, 2024</time>
