I’m sure you can pick out hundreds of examples, but that’s not my real life,” Dan <a href=#>told Entertainment Weekly</a>.</p><p>“When I play these games, it’s my chance to live my hobby. I really enjoy playing these games and I don’t do it in real life because I’m just a nice guy… or so they think,” Dan added.</p><p>Janelle was more abrupt with her answer to the question.</p><p>“The most traitorous thing that I’ve ever done? I would never admit to that. So maybe I am a true Traitor, but I would never admit that,” Janelle stated.</p><p>Below is a teaser trailer released by Peacock ahead of the new season.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-more-about-the-traitors-2>More about The Traitors 2</h2><p><a href=#>Here is a breakdown of The Traitors 2 cast</a> and the game rules.
