Long before she was on ABC’s The Bachelor, Maynard was engaged to another famous man — NASCAR driver <strong>Ricky Hendrick</strong>. However, before the couple was married, Hendrick was killed in a plane crash at the age of 24. Tragically, a week after his death, Maynard found out she was pregnant with his child. She gave birth to their daughter, Josephine Riddick Hendrick, known as Ricki, in June 2005.</p><p>Maynard found herself falling in love again with another famous man in season 15 of The Bachelor. It was there that Maynard won over the heart of series star <a href=#><strong>Brad Womack</strong></a>. Although Womack proposed to Maynard at the end of the series, the couple did not stay together long. After months of media speculation, Womack and Maynard confirmed their split in June 2011, when Maynard returned the Neil Lane sparkler Womack offered during his TV proposal.</p><p>On The Bachelorette in 2012, Maynard narrowed down her 25 suitors to race car driver <strong>Arie Luyendyk, Jr.</strong> and entrepreneur <a href=#><strong>Jef Holm</strong></a>.
