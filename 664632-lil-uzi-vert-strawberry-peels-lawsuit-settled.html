A deluxe edition of LUV's <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel="nofollow noopener">Eternal Atake</a>, released a week earlier, the album included a number of additional tracks.

According to Sun City Publishing, who own the rights to "Dim Da Lights", the sample was used without permission and <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">thus they filed suit</a>. The lawsuit, filed in January, listed LUV, Wheezy, Young Thug, Gunna, Atlantic Records, and Generation Now as defendants. The primary aim of the suit was to recoup compensation in the wake of the song's popularity.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-luv-and-sun-city-publishing-reach-undisclosed-agreement>LUV And Sun City Publishing Reach Undisclosed Agreement</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">According to a report from AllInHipHop, a Joint Notice was filed by Sun City Publishing and the Atlantic Records Corporation to inform the court a settlement had been reached. “Plaintiff Sun City Publishing, LLC, and defendants Atlantic Recording Corporation, erroneously sued as Atlantic Records LLC and Generation Now, LLC, submit this Joint Notice to advise the Court that they have reached an agreement in principle for the resolution of this action, in its entirety, and that they anticipate filing within thirty days their Stipulation to the dismissal of this action,” the filing reportedly said. No trial date had been set to hear the case, which had originally been filed in late January 2023.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Sun City Publishing had been seeking damages in excess of $1 million for the use of the unauthorized sample. This figure was reached due to the massive popularity of "Strawberry Peels", which has been over 39 million times on Spotify and played over 4 million times on YouTube. However, the specific details of the settlement were not disclosed in the filing. Despite this, LUV and his co-defendants will be able to put this matter behind them. Furthermore, they will be able to do so without facing a jury trial. LUV is currently preparing to begin his 16*29 Tour, which begins in Virginia Beach on April 29.</p><p>About The Author</p><p>Benjamin Mock (they/them) is a sports and culture writer working out of Philadelphia.
