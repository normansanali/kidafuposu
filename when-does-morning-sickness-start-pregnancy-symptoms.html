Around 20 to 30 per cent of women are lucky enough to avoid experiencing morning sickness. Every pregnancy is unique, so you're likely to find that you have different symptoms to pregnant friends or family members, or even from one pregnancy to the next.</p><h2>When does morning sickness end?</h2><p id=eaBrxLAP1uIb data-wc=29>Morning sickness often fades away at the end of the first trimester, and for the majority of women it typically clears up by weeks 16 to 20 of pregnancy.</p><p id=eLM39IwPpTdq data-wc=29>If your symptoms are severe or you are dehydrated or losing weight, it's best to contact your GP or midwife so that you can be assessed and receive treatment.</p><h3><strong>References:</strong></h3><p id=e9vbsyzP6QsC data-wc=34></p><p id=eSOiv2maw0tN data-wc=22></p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
