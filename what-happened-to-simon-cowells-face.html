One may remember him for his biting sarcasm and brutal remarks during the auditions while there are many who credit him with the creation of One Direction, one of the biggest and most popular boy bands of all time.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=359 data-current-count=359 data-injectable=false>Over the years, the 63-year-old TV personality has made a striking appearance before the camera with enough sassiness to impress the fans. So, when he released his now-deleted Twitter video with drastic transformations in his facial features, the majority of the audience was completely taken aback with a few going as far as commenting on these very changes.</p><p data-characters=37 data-current-count=396 data-injectable=false>Let’s shed some light on the topic.</p><h2 id=h-did-simon-cowell-get-facial-surgery data-injectable=false><strong>Did Simon Cowell get facial surgery?</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Simon-Cowell.png><p data-characters=199 data-current-count=199 data-injectable=false>It all happened last year on November 2022 when Cowell released a Twitter video asking the potential candidates to contact him for the reality shows America’s Got Talent and Britain’s Got Talent.</p><p data-characters=277 data-current-count=476 data-injectable=true>In a clip, Cowell succinctly put forward his message, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">saying,</a> “I always say on this show, two or three minutes can change your life. And it has.&nbsp;And maybe this time, it’s gonna be you. So, please audition now for next year’s season, and I look forward to meeting you.”</p><p data-characters=265 data-current-count=265 data-injectable=false>However, it was not a much-anticipated show that captured the public’s attention — but the reality TV host’s face which immediately became the subject of conversation. People were constantly wondering if Cowell underwent some sort of cosmetic surgery.</p><p data-characters=195 data-current-count=460 data-injectable=true>According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">YouTuber Lorry Hill</a> in her video, “Why is Simon Cowell’s Face Melting? His Plastic Surgery Nightmare?” some of the major changes could be detected in his nose and face.</p><p data-characters=286 data-current-count=286 data-injectable=false>Unlike his past pictures where Cowell’s tip of the nose appears to be much thinner and the bridge much thicker, the new picture shows a thicker edge and a thinner bridge. This, Hill believes, is due to revision rhinoplasty, a procedure where cartilage is added to the tip of the nose.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Simon Cowell’s face looks like if George Michael’s corpse was playable character in Goldeneye. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/c4OS7tIlUL</a></p>— Metal Petal (@KingRinTin) <a href=#>December 1, 2022</a><p data-characters=239 data-current-count=525 data-injectable=true>One of the changes that stood out is his shiny face with loose cheeks, which is probably the result of the face fillers. The television series host has a history of plastic surgeries and Botox which, in his opinion, didn’t suit him well.</p><p data-characters=356 data-current-count=356 data-injectable=false>Speaking of the same, he said he always preferred a healthier lifestyle to surgeries by saying, “There was a phase where everyone was having their faces pumped full of this and the other. But actually, for me now, a lot of it comes down to healthy eating and drinking tons of water.” But unlike his celebrity cohorts, Cowell claimed he looked horrific.</p><p data-characters=190 data-current-count=546 data-injectable=true>Cowell wasn’t the only person who held this opinion. After the video, social media users took to their platform to comment on the facial changes, some of which bordered on abject meanness.</p><p data-characters=277 data-current-count=277 data-injectable=false>As one of the users said, “Simon Cowell’s face looks as if George Michael’s corpse was a playable character in GoldenEye.” One of the commentators mentioned that he looked like the son of Herman Munster, whereas others compared him to Madame Tussaud’s waxwork. &nbsp;</p><p data-characters=81 data-current-count=358 data-injectable=false>With the reality shows approaching, we look forward to more updates about Cowell.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TEqa3TZp%2BaqKCau6awjK2mZquZoryvecKorp6knKh6p63CnmY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./brianne-howey-mother-what-happened-to-colleen-braun.html><span>←</span><span>What Happened To Colleen Braun?</span></a>
