Born on April 21, 1926, she was daughter to King George VI and Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother as well as older sister to Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon (born August 21, 1930), who passed away in 2002.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Her Majesty married the late former Greek royal <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a9602523/prince-philip-duke-of-edinburgh-dies/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Philip Mountbatten" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">Philip Mountbatten</a>, later titled His Royal Highness the Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, at Westminster Abbey in London on November 20, 1947. The queen and duke first met in 1934 at the wedding of Princess Marina of Greece and Denmark and Prince George, Duke of Kent, later reconnecting in 1939 at the Royal Naval College in Dartmouth, where the two reportedly fell in love. The royal pair were married for over seven decades and shared four children together: Charles, Prince of Wales (1948); Anne, Princess Royal (1950); Andrew, Duke of York (1960); and Edward, Earl of Wessex (1964). Philip died on April 9, 2021, at age 99.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The queen was additionally royal matriarch to eight grandchildren and 12 great-grandchildren. Prince Charles, Her Majesty's direct heir to the throne, welcomed her grandsons Prince William and Harry of Wales in 1982 and 1984 with Diana, Princess of Wales (whom Charles married in 1981). The queen was also grandmother to Peter and Zara Philipps; Lady Louise Windsor; and James, Viscount Severn; as well as Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie of York. Her royal great-grandchildren include Prince George, Princess Charlotte, and Prince Louis of Cambridge; Savannah and Isla Philips; Mia Grace, Lena Elizabeth, and Lucas Philip Tindall; Archie Harrison and Lilibet Diana Mountbatten-Windsor; and Sienna Elizabeth Mapelli Mozzi.</p><img alt="london, england june 13 l r camilla, duchess of cornwall, prince charles, prince of wales, prince george of cambridge, prince william, duke of cambridge, catherine, duchess of cambridge, queen elizabeth ii, prince harry and prince philip, duke of edinburgh r watch the fly past from the balcony of buckingham palace following the trooping the colour ceremony on june 13, 2015 in london, england the ceremony is queen elizabeth iis annual birthday parade and dates back to the time of charles ii in the 17th century, when the colours of a regiment were used as a rallying point in battle photo by chris jacksongetty images" title="Trooping The Colour" width=4185 height=2671 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-476957156-1645568791.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v2">Chris Jackson</span><span class="css-bf2l0q e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p>Queen Elizabeth on the balcony of Buckingham Palace following the 2015 Trooping the Colour ceremony.

She has since served as head of the commonwealth, for which she led an association of 54 independent nations and became a force of international <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.worldhistoryedu.com/queen-elizabeth-ii-10-major-achievements/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="socioeconomic change" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">socioeconomic change</a>.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Throughout her 70-year reign, the queen visited over 110 countries and lived through some of the most pivotal points in modern history, including World War II, the Cold War, and the Brexit crisis.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Her Majesty was a dedicated supporter of her country and people. At the height of the Second World War, Elizabeth II, then just a teen, made strides to boost the country's morale with periodical radio broadcasts including the BBC's Children's Hour. She also later served as a mechanic and truck driver in the women's Auxiliary Territorial Service, making her the first and only female royal to have served in the army. In addition, the queen was a demonstrated champion of gender equality, having helped pass the Crown Act of 2013, which called for the dissociation of succession from gender, granting female royals equal opportunity to stand in line for the throne.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Her Majesty was adored for her ingenuity and grounded sense of humor. Famously documented playing with her dogs or beaming at the sight of cows, the queen will be missed for her passion for animals, her love of derbies, and her regal calmness amid trying times in modern history.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In March 2014, Queen Elizabeth sat for a series of new portraits by photographer David Bailey in honor of her 88th birthday that appeared in Harper’s Bazaar in support of the U.K.’s GREAT Britain campaign, an initiative designed to showcase British creative talent around the world. The dress the queen wore for the session was chosen with the help of her longtime assistant and designer, Angela Kelly, who worked with her since 1994. The jewelry the queen selected for the portraits—a beaming sapphire-and-diamond necklace and matching earrings—were a gift from her father, George VI, on the occasion of her wedding to Philip. The images—majestic, but also surprisingly candid and even joyful—revealed a very human side of a woman who, for her entire adult life, was required to be so much more.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Her death marks a turning point for the British monarchy, as her son Prince Charles and grandson Prince William will now shape the future of the royal family.</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 e1jtuqk11"></span><h5 class="css-9jelqa e1jtuqk13">Queen Elizabeth II's Royal Life in Photos</h5><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 e1jtuqk10"></span><img alt="little princess" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/princess-elizabeth-later-queen-elizabeth-ii-reaches-up-to-news-photo-1634935920.jpg title="Little Princess" width=2817 height=3756 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center>Open Gallery<span class="css-1w4f7je es31yw60"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/arrow-right.7440adc.svg alt title="Black right arrow" width=100% height=auto decoding=async role=img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfmLKtscGroK2xX6GutbHSrWaaa2hlgHl%2FmG9mqq2VmrtuscuisZqalam1brXIZpuinZRirqixjHJtaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./painting-with-john-season-release-date-cast-plot-trailer.html><span>←</span><span>Painting With John Season 2: Release Date, Cast, Plot, Trailer, and Other Latest Updates !</span></a>
