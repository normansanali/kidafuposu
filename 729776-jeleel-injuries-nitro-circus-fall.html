Unfortunately, it was for some pretty horrifying reasons. The artist was at the Nitro Circus event in California on Sunday. He tried to do their mega-ramp while on some sort of tricycle. However, halfway down the ramp, he careened off to the side and ended up falling face-first to the floor from a fairly high distance. It was extremely frightening, and fans were left wondering whether or not he was okay.</p><p><strong>Read More: <a href=# rel>JELEEL!

Suffers Brutal Fall</h2></span><p>Following the fall, there was all sorts of speculation as to what went down. However, JELEEL! was able to quell people's fears as he took to social media where he offered a relieving message. "I’m good y’all! Appreciate everyone’s concerns, walked out the hospital with a few stitches! Alhumdullilah!" he wrote. The artist looked a bit worse for wear considering one of his eyes was almost shut. Furthermore, the gash on his abdomen looked pretty gnarly. Regardless, he seems to be doing fine despite the height of the fall.</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-artist-responds>The Artist Responds</h2></span><p>Hopefully, JELEEL! takes a bit of a break from being a daredevil.
