So far, J.J. Abrams and squad have dropped two trailers into the ether of the Internet, each one sending fans into a tizzy guessing plot points. The buildup to the film's debut is also putting more emphasis on the stars, from those returning—like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Harrison Ford</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Carrie Fisher</a>—to the franchise's newcomers, like John Boyega and Oscar Isaac. But it's the woman at the center of it all, Daisy Ridley as Rey, who is beginning to capture the hearts of a whole new generation. Her aura is so powerful in the trailers and her spot so prominent on the posters, that many people are falling hard while hardly know anything about her. So just who is the newest resident of this legendary sci-fi universe? Scroll down to get to know Daisy Ridley a little better.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>1.

She graduated in 2010 from Tring Park School for the Performing Arts in Hertfordshire, England (past students include <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Downton Abbey</a> actresses <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Jessica Brown Findlay</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>Lily James</a>.) She acted exclusively there until being cast in the Star Wars saga.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>2. She is a quadruple threat: actor, model, singer, and dancer.</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>A few years ago I did an advert for 'ASOS for Africa'...

Not only does she act, but she also sings jazz, dances, and has modeled in various campaigns, including ads for ASOS.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>3. Her Instagram became popular almost overnight.</strong></p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-low-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Instagram/@daisyridley</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">It's only been about three months since Ridley created her Instagram account, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>@daisyridley</a> and she's already popular on the social network. Her account boasts 142K followers and counting after just 12 weeks of activity.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>4.

Ortega/Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Star Wars creator George Lucas has a fondness for unknown names, so it was no surprise that he picked someone unknown to many for this mega part. Before landing this role of a lifetime, the British beauty had guest parts in the television series Silent Witness and Casualty, and acted in short film Blue Season as part of the SCI-FI-LONDON 48 Hour Film Challenge.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>5.

Ridley played Jo, a rescuer. Viewers could choose her actions in the film—to save the victim or do nothing.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>6. She's obsessed with #FitnessFridays.</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>I was struggling today; there was a lot of 'I can't breathe, I'm gonna die' but @gravzy12 got me there in the end... #beastmode #gainzzzzzz #fitnessfriday #swole</a></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_37-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">A video posted by @daisyridley on Nov 6, 2015 at 4:14am PST</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_39-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Since the induction of her Instagram account, Ridley has been posting a video showing her fitness routine every Friday. The videos consist mainly of free-weight workouts and body-weight circuits. They're really intense, but they're all done under the supervision of her trainer. Follow him at <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>@gravzy12</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_41-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>7.
