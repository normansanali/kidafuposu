Corey is also one of the owners of ”The World Famous Gold and Silver Pawn Shop’ in Las Vegas.</p><p>So just how rich is Corey Harrison, as of early 2017? Authoritative sources estimate that Corry’s net worth is over $2.5 million, with the main source of his wealth being Corey’s business activities revolving around pawn, and his appearances on TV.</p><h3>Corey Harrison Net Worth $2.5 Million</h3><p>Corey Harrison became familiar with business when he was just nine years old, when he started working in his grandfather <a href=#>“Old Man” Harrison’s</a> company with his classmate <a href=#>Austin Chumlee Russell</a>. At first he only polished jewellery in the shop, but later he gained wider experience and the trust of his grandfather and his own father, <a href=#>Rick Harrison</a>. Corey moved steadily up to the post of manager, and continues working in this position, so it has been the main sources of Corey Harrison’s net worth.</p><p>In 2009 Corey and his family decided to create a show about their own business, and this is how the TV program entitled “Pawn Stars” came into being. It portrays the routine of the shop and its workers, as well as showing how they communicate with their customers and amongst each other. The show has already been airing for nine seasons, and it too has had a significant impact on the growth of Corey’s net worth. There is also every possibility that Corey will become the head of the company; he has just a five per cent stake at the moment.</p><p>Corey also appeared in an episode of the TV series “iCurly” in November 2012, which contributed modestly to his net worth.</p><p>To talk about Corey Harrison’s personal life, he was married to fellow high school student Charlene, but their marriage ended in divorce in 2015. He appears to have recovered completely from gastric lap band surgery in 2010, which saw his weight drop from over 350 lbs to 250. As Corey gained money from his business and other activities, he has invested by buying various assets, including expensive and authentic cars. Las Vegas remains his home town.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table class=interesting_facts readability=1><tr><th>#</th><th>Fact</th></tr><tr readability=2><td>1</td><td>Son of Rick Harrison.
