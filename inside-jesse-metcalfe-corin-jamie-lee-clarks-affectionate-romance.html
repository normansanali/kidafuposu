I mean, you gotta put some effort into something, whether it’s planning something or <a href=#>buying something for them</a> [that] they’ll enjoy or doing something special,” he said. “It really is a day to, you know, to honor the love that you share with somebody.”</p><p>Although the <a href=#>Chesapeake Shores alum</a> is all about showering his girlfriend with affection, he isn’t sure when the couple will take their next relationship step. When asked whether he was thinking about starting a family anytime soon, Metcalfe played coy, responding, “TBD.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Inside-Jesse-Metcalfe-GF-Corin-Romance-Im-Pretty-Affectionate-0003.jpg><p>The California native, who recently moved from Los Angeles to Miami, also dished about why he chooses to keep his romance separate from his career.</p><p>“I don’t really love to, like, bring my significant other to the workplace. I mean, it’s fine,” Metcalfe told Us, revealing that Clark doesn’t come to visit him on set. “But for me, I’m just so focused on what I’m doing. Especially if, you know, there’s a romantic storyline … It feels a little strange.”</p><p>After breaking into Hollywood in the late ‘90s, <a href=#>the Desperate Housewives alum</a> has become a pro at managing both his love life and his acting work. Most recently, Metcalfe teamed up with <a href=#><strong>Jessica Lowndes</strong></a> for GAC Family’s first original Valentine’s Day movie, Harmony From the Heart.</p><p>“I liked the role [and] I’d never played a doctor on TV before, let alone a heart surgeon. And I really, actually, liked the story [because] I felt like it was about loss and grief,” he explained to Us. “That was the reason why these two characters, specifically my character, shut down romantically. [Then] through helping my character’s grandfather recover from a mild stroke, my character opens up again and then finds love with Jessica’s character.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Harmony-From-The-Heart-Jesse-Metcalfe-Jessica-Lowndes.jpg><p>Metcalfe, who called his costar a “total powerhouse,” added: “I just thought it was a really interesting story that hadn’t been told within this genre yet. I thought it was a cool opportunity.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Harmony From the Heart premieres on GAC Family Saturday, February 12, at 8 p.m. ET.
