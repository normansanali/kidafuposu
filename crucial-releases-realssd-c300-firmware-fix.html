In it I pointed out that not only had my review sample apparently bricked itself but I was also able to get the C300 into a state of extremely low performance (~20MB/s) that it could not get out of, even if I TRIMed the whole drive.</p><p>Crucial discovered the source of the problems and promised a fix in mid April. It's a bit later than that but we do finally have an update from Crucial. <a href=#>An updated fw has been posted to Crucial's site</a> (Version 0002) and it promises the following fixes:</p><p>&nbsp;Change Log:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul class=bullet><li>Improved Power Consumption</li><li>Improved TRIM performance</li><li>Enabled the Drive Activity Pin (Pin 11)</li><li>Improved Robustness due to unexpected power loss</li><li>Improved data management to reduce maximum write latency</li><li>Improved Performance of SSD as it fills up with data</li><li>Improved Data Integrity</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The update is destructive so you'll lose all of your data when you apply it. I haven't had the opportunity to test it thoroughly yet so if you're concerned, you may want to wait until others have used it. If you are a C300 owner, please feel free to leave your experiences with the update in the comments below.</p><p><strong>Update:</strong>&nbsp;It seems as though the new firmware, designed to prevent drives from bricking,&nbsp;<a href=#>appears to be bricking drives</a>. Hold off on this one guys.</p><p>I've also requested a 128GB C300 for review and I should see that in the coming days. I've got a ton of non-SSD stuff to deal with this week so I'm not sure I'll be able to get to all of it before I leave for Spain this weekend. If I can't get it done before I leave, I'll definitely tackle it all when I get back.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7orrAp5utnZOde6S7zGiqoaenZIB3hZNomqutk56urXnRnqOemaOawG6%2BxJqjrKuUYrB0fI9mnaKqnayus7GMn6Cx</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./bradley-james-net-worth-131243.html><span>←</span><span>Bradley James Net Worth</span></a>
