However, as the year progressed, things began to improve.</p><p>In July, Bjorklund reached the semi-finals of an ITF/Tennis Europe event in Germany and then won a similar event in Belgium. She then advanced to the finals of an ITF event in Italy but was defeated.</p><p>She finished the year on a high note by winning an ITF/USTA event, giving her two ITF singles titles. Bjorklund was also successful in&nbsp;doubles ranks, where she won a further two titles.</p><p>She continues to balance her tennis career with her romance with Shapovalov and hence the best is yet to come.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmJa7orLUqGWcp51kuqq%2ByZqkZpqapL%2BsuNSnm2g%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./marina-pearl-leblanc-parents-and-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Marina Pearl LeBlanc | Parents And Net Worth</span></a>
