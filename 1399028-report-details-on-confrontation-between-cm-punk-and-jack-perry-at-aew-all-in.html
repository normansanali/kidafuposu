Multiple reports have since provided more details.</p><p>As first reported by Sean Ross Sapp of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Fightful</a>, Punk and Perry got into a backstage confrontation at the show. Reports have since emerged that paint conflicting pictures of the incident, as some sides blame Punk for starting it, and vice versa.</p><p>Nick Hausman of <a href=#>Haus of Wrestling</a> reports that, per sources, Punk waited in the Gorilla position prior to the show, and he walked up to Perry. The conversation escalated, and Perry told him to “do something about it.” Punk was then said to have shoved him and eventually put him in a chokehold to neutralize him.</p><p>Per Hausman, Punk then walked to his dressing room, and he talked to AEW security. When he was told it might make things easier if he left, he did so of his own accord. He then went back to his hotel and later met up with other talent. The report noted that it did not sound like there had been much, if any, communication between Punk and AEW since the show.</p><h2 id=h-even-more-details-on-confrontation-between-cm-punk-and-jack-perry>Even More Details On Confrontation Between CM Punk And Jack Perry</h2><p>In another update, Nick Hausman of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Haus Of Wrestling</a> reported that when CM Punk landed at Heathrow Airport ahead of AEW All In on August 26, no one from AEW was there to meet him. Hausman wrote that there was no car service for Punk. When he texted a number AEW gave him for the driver, it reportedly bounced back as an invalid number. Per Hausman, Punk wound up finding his own way to the hotel.</p><p>Furthermore, Wade Keller of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">PWTorch</a> writes that, per sources, in the aftermath of the incident, Punk was threatening to quit, in the heat of the moment, due to his frustration. Punk has expressed his desire to have a “drama-free locker room”, despite being tied to some controversies since his return.</p><p>Perry was said to have told Punk that he started something. This referred to Punk’s camp reportedly putting out the word that Perry wanted to use real glass in an angle. Perry reportedly felt that this made him look bad. As a result, he responded with his comments about “real glass” at AEW All In.</p><p>Keller cited one AEW source close to management who expressed their belief that Perry will end up being blamed more than CM Punk, and potentially facing more ramifications, as his comments ignited the situation. Keller also noted that there is some backstage frustration with the whole incident, as it distracted from what should have been a major high point for AEW.</p><p>At the AEW All In post-show press conference, Tony Khan <a href=#>confirmed that an incident happened </a>backstage. He stated said that it is under investigation.</p><p>WrestleZone will provide more information as it becomes available.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZJycGlqaGK%2FprzOq6tmnJWprqq40mamp2WTpLunvs6nq5qsmaS7bq7Era6enZ5isK55z66lpGWRo7FutsCcomaolae%2FunnArWSanadirq24jKKl</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./tj-hockenson.html><span>←</span><span>NFL Draft, Net Worth, Injury, Pro Bowl</span></a>
