Growing up, that just wasn’t an essential step in our skincare routine! But now that we work in beauty, we’ve had to step up our game.

The celeb-loved beauty brand just launched this skincare treatment that helps target rough texture, dark spots and Keratosis Pilaris. In addition to eliminating pore-clogging residue and dead skin build-up, these pads leave your skin smoother and brighter. And unlike most exfoliants, this product is a leave-on treatment that you don’t have to wash off. Read on to find out why you need these pore-minimizing pads in your life!</p><p><strong>Get the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">KP Body Bumps Be Gone Clarifying Body Pads</a> for just <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$36</a> at Kopari!</strong></p><p>Kopari’s KP Body Bumps Be Gone Clarifying Body Pads are hot off the press!

Formulated with 4.4% AHAs, coconut oil, willow bark extract and aloe, these biodegradable body pads can revitalize skin on the go.

Plus, 87% said that the pads were non-irritating and 82% said that the exfoliator smooths skin bumpiness!</p><p>Just last week, I tried a rough exfoliating towel that made my skin break out in a bumpy rash — basically the opposite of the intended outcome.
