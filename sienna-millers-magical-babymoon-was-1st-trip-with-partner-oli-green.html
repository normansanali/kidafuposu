The notoriously private couple welcomed their daughter (whose name has not been revealed to the public) in late 2023.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-2153736474-Sienna-Miller-Says-Magical-Babymoon-Was-Her-1st-Vacation-Ever-With-Boyfriend-Oli-Green.jpg><p>While they did not announce the birth, Miller and Green were <a href=#>spotted out in London</a> with their newborn in January. (Miller also shares daughter Marlowe, 11, with ex-fiancé <strong>Tom Sturridge</strong>.) Before that, news of Miller’s pregnancy broke last August when she was <a href=#>photographed bikini-clad</a> showing off her baby bump while on vacation in Ibiza with Green and Marlowe.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Last year, the Anatomy of a Scandal actress said she had long wanted to give Marlowe a sibling. “I felt so bad that Marlowe didn’t have a little partner in crime,” Miller told <a href=#>Vogue</a> in her December 2023 cover story. “So I became that for her. I think I tried to compensate for every bit that she was lacking.”</p><p>Miller, who has a 14-year age gap with Green, opened up about her decision to freeze her eggs when she turned 40 in an April 2022 interview with <a href=# rel=noopener>Elle UK</a>, where she also expressed her desire to have more children.</p><p>“Biology is incredibly cruel on women in that decade [of their 30s] — that’s the headline, or it certainly was for me,” she said at the time. “Then I got to 40 and I froze some eggs. Having been really focused on the need to have another baby, I’m just like, if it happens, it happens. That kind of existential threat has dissipated.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGasoZWju6J5zKKjpZ2iqHqurcaimpqkXZeuo8XMqKanZaeWwG590q1kraqZpXq4tdOhZKmZoqm7pr6MqKOiZZensqa6jg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ryan-larsen-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-86518-html.html><span>←</span><span>Ryan Larsen Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</span></a>
