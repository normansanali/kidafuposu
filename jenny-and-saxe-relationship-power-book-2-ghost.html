Jenny is a woman who’s about her business in and out of the courtroom. She works hard and plays hard, which is something her boo Cooper Saxe (Shane Johnson) can attest to."><meta name=author content="Jenniffer Sheldon"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

Most viewers remember Saxe being a jerk to his colleagues, having a knack for porn, and nearly getting himself killed on multiple occasions.</p><p>However, it appears that Saxe was a bit of a loverboy during his time on Power. Paton explains that Jenny and Saxe briefly dated in the past and it “hasn't been fully spoken about on the show.”</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Power Book II: Ghost (@ghoststarz)</a></p></figure><p>“Jenny and Saxe did date in a real way before Season 1 of [Power Book II: Ghost] in their past at some point when he was on Power,” Paton exclusively told Distractify. “They were sort of dating, and it didn't end well.”</p><p>Interestingly, Paton shares that Saxe’s jealous nature from their past is now resurfacing, which is causing issues between the pair — from Saxe “being too jealous and controlling.”</p><p>“We are starting to see that again because he's not getting what he wants from Jenny,” Paton told us, which falls in line with Saxe following Jenny to her residence since he feels she’s hiding something. “So all that stuff is coming out because he's scared of losing.”</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Starz</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Jenny Sullivan does not trust Cooper Saxe as an informant, but she knows that she needs him.</h2><p>Although Jenny and Saxe have been bed buddies on Power Book II: Ghost, it’s clear as day that Jenny can't trust that man as far as she can throw him. Saxe can be very sneaky and irrational, which usually works against him.</p><p>However, Paton shares that Jenny has mastered the art of “keeping a lot of her feelings in a little box locked up inside.” So her ability to compartmentalize allows her to enjoy Saxe the lover, but also use him to connect the dots with her pursuits.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Shane Johnson (@shane_m_johnson)</a></p></figure><p>“She doesn't trust [Saxe],” Paton told us. “But she does think that he could help. He's in the right place at the right time. So she's taking a risk. That's why she's not telling him everything. So she is working with him, but she is also working him a little bit at the same time."</p><p>Paton added, “She takes him with a grain of salt, but she does know that she needs him to a certain extent.”</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Jenny Sullivan is using Cooper Saxe to help get evidence on his boss Davis MacLean that ties to Tariq St. Patrick.</h2><p>Jenny is gunning for a victory this time around.
