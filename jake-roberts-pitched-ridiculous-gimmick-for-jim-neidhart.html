Neidhart was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame in 2019 as part of The Hart Foundation.</p><p>“I love to create new characters. Oh my God. I had one character I wanted to do for Jim Neidhart and the deal was going to be he’s called ‘The Mole’, and what happens is he refuses to come out to the ring till they turn the lights off, because it’s too bright. It’s much too bright. I can’t see. It’s too bright. Turn the lights off and I’ll come out. Of course, you turn the lights off, he comes out and whacks the fu*king guy. The lights come back on and he’s beating the sh*t out of the guy. He’s The Mole.”</p><p>Vince McMahon retired back in July and left the reins to Triple H. Jake Roberts might have been happy about this fact in the end. Regardless, he is in AEW now and that’s what matters.</p><p><strong>What’s your take on this creative pitch?
