One of the first legendary animals that you will encounter in Red Dead Redemption 2 is Legendary Bear (Grizzly Bear). You will be tasked to hunt down this Legendary Bear in the Exit Pursued By A Bruised Ego Mission of Chapter 2. There are high chances that you won’t be successful in hunting down the Grizzly Bear in your first attempt and you may die, and if you decide to go after the bear immediately after you respawned then you won’t find it at the same particular location."><meta name=author content="Jenniffer Sheldon"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

The Grizzly Bear is the first Legendary Animal you face in the game, during a Chapter 2 mission, we advise you to skip meeting with him and move ahead in the story, level up your skills by playing ahead and once you are equipped with better weapons, come back and hunt down the Grizzly Bear.</p><p data-injection=true>If you are among one of those players who doesn’t want to move ahead in the story without defeating the Legendary Grizzly Bear even though you have died multiple times then follow the instructions provided below.</p><p>When you respawned (after your battle with the Legendary Bear where you died), you have to ride a bit away and set up a camp. Once the camp setup is done, go to sleep until the next morning. Ride back up towards the icon. As you do this, you will see a notification popped up on your screen (Top-Left side of the screen) stating that you have entered a Legendary Animal Territory. Make use of your hunting skill and track down the animal.</p><p data-injection=true>The notification pop-up is a must in order to if that doesn’t happen, the Legendary Bear won’t spawn. So keep an eye on it.</p><p>For more interesting guide like this, check out our <a href=# title="Red Dead Redemption 2 Wiki">Red Dead Redemption 2 Wiki Page</a> – it carries all story missions walkthrough, how to activate fast travel, all legendary animals map location and rewards you unlock after hunt them down, and many other things.</p><h3>About the author</h3><img alt src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/secure.gravatar.com/avatar/a2f2b9c20e6647ed005cde2a4fac920e?s=192&d=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamepur.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2020%2F01%2Fcropped-gamepur_favicon-1-192x192.png&r=g2x" height=96 width=96 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h3>Sehran Shaikh</h3><p class=author-url></p><p class=author-desc>Sehran is the Associate Editor and one of the co-founders of Gamepur.
