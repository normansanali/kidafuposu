These goals today in the opening of a World Cup make him the best for all Ecuadoreans," said Victor López, an 18-year-old fan from the city of Ibarra in north Ecuador watching the game on a giant screen in a shopping mall.</p><p>Valencia, who was taken off for the last 15 minutes of Sunday's Group A game, has had a decade-long career in the Ecuador side, starting off as a winger but being converted to a striker in the qualifiers for the 2014 World Cup.</p><p>He moved to West Ham United in a 12-million pound ($14.26 million)deal after the tournament in Brazil. After two seasons with the London side, he endured an uninspiring loan spell at Everton.</p><p>Valencia is now with Fenerbahce and in rich scoring form. His 13 league goals this season has put him top of the scoring charts in Turkey.</p><p>It was the fourth time in the last five World Cups that a player scored a double in the opening game of a tournament after Germany’s Miroslav Klose (2006), Neymar of Brazil (2014) and Russian striker Denis Cheryshev in 2018.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sLrMmqWoqpGirm%2BvzqZmrKifp8G0e8Wopq2akaG5cH6Pa2loaWFkf3J7xaKdmmWnpL%2BtsIycrKlloZbBor6MnqWnnaJiw6K4xKeaopldmrC2rcOoqWegpKK5</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sullivans-crossing-season-1-episode-5-release-date-recap-review-spoilers-streaming-schedule-where-to-watch-html.html><span>←</span><span>Sullivans Crossing Season 1 Episode 5 Release Date : Recap, Review, Spoilers, Streaming, Schedule Wh</span></a>
