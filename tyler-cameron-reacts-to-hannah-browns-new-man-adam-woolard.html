Cameron, however, told the outlet on Tuesday that “we just cared for each other as people,” noting they remain friends.</p><p>“We want each other to be the best person we can be,” he added. “If that’s being happy with other people then that’s what we want.”</p><p>The <a href=#>Barkitecture cohost</a>, for his part, was romantically linked to model <a href=#><strong>Camila Kendra</strong></a> last month but did not confirm he is <a href=#>currently in a relationship</a>.</p><p>“I keep that world private,” he explained. “There are just things I want to do for myself and work life and construction that I am excited about. That really has my focus right now. I am extremely happy. Things are going great right now. I am pushing myself in new ways and am excited to see what has all come out of it.”</p><p>Brown made headlines in January 2021 when she was <a href=#>spotted holding hands in Los Angeles</a> with Woolard, 33. A fan account also posted photos of the pair dining together in Nashville days earlier.</p><p>A source exclusively told Us Weekly at the time that “<a href=#>they seem like a great match</a>,” noting that both are from the south. The pair “seems like they are taking things slow” for now, the insider added.</p><p>The Alabama native and the model have yet to speak about the relationship, but Brown and Cameron’s mutual friend <a href=#><strong>Matt James</strong></a> <a href=#>commented on the romance earlier this month</a>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I couldn’t approve more,” James, 29, told Entertainment Tonight in February. “I actually had a chance to meet him, and he’s incredible.”</p><p>The <a href=#>Bachelor</a> star explained that Brown dating is positive for both her and Cameron, who has been <a href=#>friends with James since college</a>.</p><p>“I’m excited for Hannah and Tyler because I think people can see that they can coexist,” the ABC Food Tour founder said. “They can be happy with people that aren’t Tyler and Hannah.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGatsZyav26vwKacq6eeYr%2BmrcKtqmasn2K1orrNmp9mmqKkxK%2B%2FjKecsGWdlrturcOapGavn6S5or7DaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./tragic-details-about-these-famous-djs.html><span>←</span><span>Tragic Details About These Famous DJs</span></a>
