At the time, he had been sober for years and had been open up about his battle with addiction over the years.</p><p>In December 2020, <a href=#>he sought treatment for alcoholism</a> and cocaine addiction, checking himself into a 60-day program at a Pennsylvania facility after <a href=#>being sober for 15 years</a>.</p><p>“It was a <a href=#>relief to his wife and family that he checked in,</a>” a source exclusively told Us at the time. “It was John’s decision. Plain and simple, John had too much downtime [in quarantine]. He had too much time in his own head.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>In September 2019, the Mulaney creator told Esquire magazine that he began drinking for “attention” as a kid. “I was really outgoing, and then at 12, I wasn’t. I didn’t know how to act. And then I was drinking, and I was hilarious again,” he said at the time. “I went on a bender that weekend that was just, like, fading in and out of a movie.”</p><p>At 23, he had a “crazy” weekend and chose to quit cold turkey. “I was like, ‘You’re f–king out of control,'” the Big Mouth actor told the magazine. “And I thought to myself, ‘I don’t like this guy anymore. I’m not rooting for him.'”</p><p>In February 2021, he returned home and continued doing outpatient treatment.
