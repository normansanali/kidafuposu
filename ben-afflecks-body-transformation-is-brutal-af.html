Ever since his career skyrocketed after <i>Good Will Hunting</i>, Ben Affleck’s life has been through a series of emotional and professional ups and downs. From battling alcohol addiction (which lead to weight gain), divorcing Jennifer Garner to building a ripped reputation during<i> Gone Girl </i>and<i> Batman V/S Superman</i>, Ben Affleck is the perfect example of a fat-to-fit body transformation.</p><p>In fact, fitness helped him beat substance abuse. When Ben Affleck was chosen to play Batman’s character, he needed to look like a heavyweight MMA fighter. With 20 months of continuous training along with trying out 500 different workouts, Ben Affleck succeeded to shock the world with his ripped body. Well, he had to look at par with Henry Cavill, who looked like an Olympic weightlifter when he played Superman. And clearly his trainer, Walton Norton Jr. did a great job at it.</p><h4>Affleck's Routine</h4><p>Affleck would work out either early in the morning or late in the night (or at both times), training six days a week. He would wake up at 4:00 am to do cardio and the, he'd train with weights late in the night after his working schedule.</p><p>Since Affleck had to gain mass and muscle, he had to do a lot of bodybuilding exercises. The muscle building and shredding routine helped Ben get the body he wanted.</p><p>And, he followed a strict diet plan designed by Beverly Hills-based nutritionist, Rehan Jalali. His 2,500-3,000 calorie diet was divided proportionately - 35% lean protein, 45% carbohydrates, and 20% essential fats. He had to abstain from eating any form of dairy products and carbs in the night.</p><p><strong>Carbohydrates</strong> – Sweet potatoes, brown rice, oatmeal, leafy vegetables, and whole-wheat pasta.</p><p><strong>Protein </strong>– Egg, sirloin steak, salmon, turkey breast, and chicken breast.</p><p><strong>Fat </strong>– Walnuts, almonds, natural butter, flax seeds and almond butter.</p><p>There’s no denying that Ben Affleck’s fitness routine is a tough task, but the results are mind-blowing. However, it may not be everyone’s cup of tea because it requires a lot of mental motivation to hit it real hard in the gym. If you think you have it in you to follow Batman’s fitness regime, you can definitely forge your body into a superhero physique.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmihnmOutLfMnqVnm5%2BifKe106ecrKtdrLyzt86uq6xnYWZ%2FcoGWa2aaqqSesK2xjpucp2WRm7OtscKkqmaan5nGbsDRmqWsnp%2BnuqLAyKilZqGjYq%2BzwdOao2aZlg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./alphonso-daviess-net-worth-biography-fact-career-awards-and-life-story.html><span>←</span><span>Alphonso Daviess net worth, biography, fact, career, awards and life story</span></a>
