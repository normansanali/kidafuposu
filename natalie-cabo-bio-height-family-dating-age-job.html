And (of course) she kept hinting that she is as much single as one can be.</p><h3 style=text-align:left><b>Natalie Cabo Family</b></h3><p>Natalie Cabo’s parents have a lighting business in Miami that they started from nothing. And she said that was the reason she actually majored in Business. “I felt the responsibility to continue their legacy. I got an associate’s degree in business and when I transferred to UNC, I started studying management and society to get the managerial aspect.” That, on the other hand, she minored in social and economic justice because she is very passionate about politics and advocacy.</p><p>To Natalie, life shines because she has her mom, Doris Cabo, by her side.</p><p>Every now and then, Natalie also mentions her dad, Andres Cabo, on her social accounts.</p><p>Natalie grew up alongside a bunch of sisters of similar age.
