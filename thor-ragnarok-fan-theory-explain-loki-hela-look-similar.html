After all, Loki and Hela are so alike that they have to be biological brother and sister. But <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">if Loki’s a Frost Giant</a>, how come he looks so much like Odin’s first born?</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=281 data-current-count=281 data-injectable=false>Well, a new theory might’ve found the perfect explanation for Loki and Hela’s similar appearance. It pools together information from 2011’s&nbsp;Thor&nbsp;and&nbsp;Ragnarok&nbsp;to work out that the mirrored looks might subconsciously be a deliberate effort on Loki’s part.</p><p data-characters=337 data-current-count=618 data-injectable=true>Inferring from a moment in&nbsp;Ragnarok&nbsp;when Loki appeared to read Valkyrie’s mind, it says that baby Loki saw a memory of Odin holding his own daughter when he was found by the warrior king as an infant. This is why he changed from his natural Frost Giant form upon being picked up and transformed into a Caucasian, green-eyed baby.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Upigbxc3Cd6ideH6u7qXk5Po5l0V0CMWKdINYaAY6Oc.jpg><p data-characters=305 data-current-count=305 data-injectable=false>This is a smartly-conceived theory that does a good job of making sense of a story that clearly developed in unexpected ways as the&nbsp;Thor&nbsp;franchise went on. For instance, Hela’s actually Loki’s daughter in the comics (and the original Norse mythology), which is why they typically look alike.</p><p data-characters=329 data-current-count=634 data-injectable=true>However, this alternate explanation for their revamped familial relationship&nbsp;works well, plus it adds a tragic new element to Loki’s character. When Odin found him as a baby, he attempted to impersonate his other child in order to be wanted by the old man. Doesn’t that make you want to give the trickster god a hug?</p><p data-characters=321 data-current-count=321 data-injectable=false>The apocalyptic-level sibling rivalry between Thor, Loki and Hela was so enjoyable in&nbsp;<strong>Thor: Ragnarok&nbsp;</strong>that&nbsp;we’d love to see them unite again. Unfortunately, though, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">two out of the three are most likely dead as things stand</a>, but fingers crossed that some sort of reset in&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Avengers 4</a>&nbsp;will bring them back to life.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJoq6GnomK%2ForPNmqmoo12brq9506GcqKqpYrK5vMuaoKdlnKS4qnnHnqOaZZykvKx50qKkoqSRp3w%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-meaning-behind-the-song-tell-him-by-patti-drew.html><span>←</span><span>The Meaning Behind The Song: Tell him by Patti Drew</span></a>
