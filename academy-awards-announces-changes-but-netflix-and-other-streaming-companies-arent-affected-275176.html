Yesterday, it was announced by the Board of Governors that the 2020 rules for the Academy Awards had made changes, albeit small ones.</p><p>Regarding Netflix and other streaming companies, the rule changes didn’t affect them, as long as the movies are screened for approximately seven-days in a Los Angeles theater with three screenings per day and paid admission.</p><p>The president of the Academy, John Bailey, said in a statement that he and the rest of the board support the theatrical experience as an important part of the culture surrounding motion pictures.</p><p>Bailey insisted that their rules have a few standards, specifically, “theatrical exhibition,” but they’ll continue allowing a wide range and diversity of productions for Oscar consideration.</p><p>Executives in the music business have been dealing with the advent of streaming technology in the last few years, while some have been critical, and others have been more accepting. Recently, it was reported that Netflix had actually purchased the Egyptian Theater in Los Angeles.</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/BwkMuwkFGQ8/</p><p>Rumor has it that the streaming juggernauts purchased the theater so they can screen their own movies there, and thus, be eligible for Oscar nomination which is very important for producers, writers, actors, actresses, and other workers on the set of a movie/TV production.</p><p>This past season, Netflix’s Roma, created by Alfonso Cuaron, was nominated for approximately 10 Academy Awards, so such a discussion is quite relevant for the Board of Governors as well as Netflix and other streaming company execs.</p><p>Previously, Steven Spielberg was one director who gave his opinion on the legitimacy of streaming companies receiving awards. The director said that when a movie commits to television, they’re not a TV movie,” which loses an element of prestigiousness in the eyes of the Academy.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Steven added that he doesn’t believe movies that are screened for seven days merely as a way of appeasing the Academy should accept nominations.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeRmK6lscyyZJqvkaextHnAp6WorZ6YsrR5wqGYp5%2BVqHqjwdNmpZ6slqG2uXnAp5tmp6SdsrN50q2pnpmdnruoecKopKmZnp6ytHnAq5ynrF2Ws6exwq2cnWVibIJyg5Vo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./why-is-who-paid-the-largest-fine-in-history-trending.html><span>←</span><span>Why is 'who paid the largest fine in history' trending?</span></a>
