Sienna is also a mom to an 11-year-old daughter named Marlowe, whom she shares with her ex Tom Sturridge. For the occasion, she exuded cool mom vibes in an oversized black leather bomber jacket that was zipped all the way up and featured a ribbed knit lining. Underneath, she wore a contrasting white slip dress with a lace-trimmed midi hemline and added a pair of extreme wedge sandals to her look, as well as a black handbag and square-shaped sunglasses.&nbsp;<br></p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Miller wore her blonde hair down in her signature boho waves with a middle part and opted for a no-makeup makeup look with a pale pink lip and rosy cheeks. &nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Back in December, Sienna spoke with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Vogue</a> about becoming a mom again later in life.
