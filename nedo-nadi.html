In the same tournament, Nadi was selected for the team épée which annoyed his father, who regarded the épée as “a crude and undisciplined weapon”.</p><p>Unlike the foil and saber, in épée, any part of the body is a legitimate hit to make a score so Guiseppe considers it as an undisciplined weapon. Nevertheless, Nedo Nadi led his team to the Olympic final and secured a team gold medal for his country.</p><p>Nedo was perfect in the fence from all aspects. His perfect balance, timing, and rapid reflexes give him a big advantage in any style of fencing.</p><p>Thus, without much difficulty, Nedo won the individual saber gold medal by 11 victories to 9.
