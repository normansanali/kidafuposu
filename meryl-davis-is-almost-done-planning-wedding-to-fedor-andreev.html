Like what songs we want to dance to. Just some final details, but yeah, almost ready!”</p><p>Despite the fact that her fellow figure skater, 37, <a href=#>proposed in July 2017</a>, Davis feels the pressure of a dwindling timeline. “We’ve been engaged for a while, and it felt like we had a lifetime to prepare,” she explained. “Now that we’re only a couple of months out, it’s like, ‘Oh, wow. This is happening really soon!’”</p><p>The ice dancer added that the pair will tie the knot in the south of France this summer, followed by a weeklong honeymoon in Europe.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Meryl-Davis-Fedor-Andreev-Wedding-Planning-02.jpg><p>Davis’ longtime figure skating partner, <a href=#><strong>Charlie White</strong></a>, will be by her side too when she walks down the aisle. “I’m already married, so she’s late to the party!” the 31-year-old athlete quipped to&nbsp;Us. “It’s odd. I mean, first of all, how awesome that I get to go to the south of France — just celebrate her and her fiancé. So I’m just happy for her.” (He married <strong>Tanith Belbin</strong> in April 2015.)</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>White went on to <a href=#>describe his bond</a> with the <a href=#>Dancing With the Stars</a> <a href=#>season 18 winner</a>. “I’ve known her and I spend more time with her probably than almost anyone else, including her parents, maybe!” he noted. “So just to see her in her best moment or moment of happiness. A lot of work for her has gone into getting it just right. And so I’ll be happy to just be on the celebratory end and enjoying it.”</p><p>Don’t expect the gold medalists to team up for a performance at the wedding, though. “No! I don’t want any spotlight,” White insisted. “I will not be taking any of it. No, no, this is about her and her fiancé!”</p><p>With reporting by Lexi Ciccone</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGamnaKuuW6wwK%2BgrGWZqHqiuMyoqq1llKS7pnnPpZinppmjtG7DxJ2boqaXYsGwecWem6iqXZa7pb7Enq1o</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./mel-gibson.html><span>←</span><span>Mel Gibson Bio, Age, Net Worth, Height, Facts, Career</span></a>
