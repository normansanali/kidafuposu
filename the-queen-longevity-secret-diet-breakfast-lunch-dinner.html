"For a main course she loved game, things like Gaelic steak, fillet steak with a mushroom whisky sauce, especially if we did it with venison," Darren has revealed.</p><p id=e4dTeG2pdnZAX data-wc=44><strong>"For a first course she loved the Gleneagles pâté, which is smoked salmon, trout and mackerel. </strong>She loved using ingredients off the estate and so if we had salmon from Balmoral from the River Dee, she'd have that, it was one of her favourites."</p><p id=ei-yNrDSjvt9o data-wc=32>He added: "We used a repertoire of dishes, mainly British and French food. We cooked a lot of traditional French food like halibut on a bed of spinach with a Mornay sauce."</p><p id=eYGIAF8tsa0mV data-wc=60>For dessert, the Queen is said to have loved strawberries from Balmoral and white peaches grown at Windsor Castle, according to . She also had&nbsp;a soft spot for chocolate. Darren told HELLO!: <strong>"She is absolutely a chocoholic.

"The reason behind that is because of free radical damage, which can affect the healthy cells in our body. So, to stay glowing and healthy, you need a ton of things like berries, organic coffee, or really high percentage cacao dark chocolate," which are a rich source of antioxidants and minerals.</p><p id=es7KaHvzCSP7L data-wc=31>Yes, you read that right. Chocolate is so antioxidant-rich, that research suggests it may even help lower the risk of heart disease, reduce inflammation and insulin resistance, and improve brain function.</p><h2><strong>What did the Queen like to drink?</strong></h2><p id=eaokRkgbN6KD_ data-wc=33>Well, we know the monarch enjoyed a good cup of tea!

It is also a myth that members of Royalty use their pinky when drinking, I have never seen that happen once."</p><p id=etGokd9Kpcp-H data-wc=54>As for an alcoholic tipple, Her Majesty was&nbsp;partial to the odd gin. In 2017, Darren McGrady spoke out on reports that the Queen drank four cocktails a day. He told : <strong>"She'd be pickled if she drank that much. All I said was she likes a gin and Dubonnet. That's her favourite drink."</strong></p><p id=eFqqQn47iMoKu data-wc=35>Darren added that when the Queen did&nbsp;have a drink with dinner, it was&nbsp;typically a glass of her favourite German sweet wine. "Just in the evening. She certainly doesn't drink four glasses a day."</p><p id=emPQA8TLBXVMF data-wc=23></p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
