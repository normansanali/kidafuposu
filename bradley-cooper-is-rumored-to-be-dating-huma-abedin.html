Despite arriving at the Met Gala 2022 together, the pair walked the red carpet separately. According to Page Six, various sources have verified to the publication that the couple has been dating “for a few months.” Anna Wintour, the editor of Vogue, introduced the pair at first.</p><p>According to the source:</p><p>“Anna obviously acted as a matchmaker. She is Bradley’s best friend and loves Huma.”</p><p>According to another source, Cooper and Abedin are “They’re “ideal for one other” since they’re both interested in “power, politics, and human affairs.”</p><h2>Everything there is to know about Huma Abedin</h2><p>Huma Abedin came to notoriety as Hillary Clinton’s longtime assistant and vice chair of her presidential campaign in 2016.&nbsp;Huma Abedin was born on July 28, 1978, in Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States. Huma is the daughter of an Indian father and a Pakistani mother, both of whom had just migrated to the United States. Her parents, Syed Zaynul Abedin and Saleha, moved to Saudi Arabia shortly after and resided for many years before returning to the United States.</p><p>Huma is the second of four children born to Syed Zanyul Abedin and Saleha. Her siblings are Hassan, Mahmoud, and Hiba.&nbsp;Syed, Huma’s father, founded the Institute of Muslim Minority Affairs in London and Saudi Arabia. He served as the editor of the Institute’s periodical, which is presently run by his wife Saleha, after being born in New Delhi in 1928.&nbsp;Abedin started her political career in 1996, working for Hillary Clinton. While attending George Washington University, the now 45-year-old personality aspired to be a writer but was instead hired as an intern in Clinton’s office.&nbsp;Hillary, former President Bill Clinton’s wife, recognized and appreciated Abedin’s role in planning the White House’s Eid party during Ramadan in 1999.</p><p>She stated:</p><p>“I must say that having Huma on my staff has allowed me to see firsthand the effect of Ramadan, and I have had several opportunities to speak with her about the specific significance of Ramadan.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Bradley-Cooper-1.jpg alt="Bradley Cooper" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Abedin has continued to work with Clinton in every capacity since then. Huma worked with Hillary Clinton when she was a U.S. Senator from 2001 to 2009, and again in 2009 while she was Secretary of State.&nbsp;Huma Abedin was a key figure in Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign, and she was engaged from the start. During the campaign, her title was changed to operations manager.</p><p>It was reported in 2015:</p><p>“Abedin has been promoted to the most senior member of Clinton’s old guard, occupying a position Clinton has long valued: the strong, trustworthy female advisor.”</p><p>Moreover, Huma’s formal title throughout the presidential campaign was vice chair.&nbsp;Huma Abedin is the ex-wife of disgraced politician and serial sex offender Anthony Weiner. After seven years of marriage, the pair divorced in 2017. Jordan Zain Weiner, their 10-year-old son, is their only child.&nbsp;Huma addressed Weiner’s transgressions in her book, Both/And: A Life in Many Worlds. She also said that Hillary Clinton’s campaign suffered as a result of negative media coverage.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Huma-Abedin-1.jpg alt="Huma Abedin" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>What about Bradley Cooper?</h2><p>Abedin’s rumored boyfriend Bradley Cooper and model Irina Shayk broke up in 2019 after four years together. Lea De Seine, their five-year-old daughter, is their only child.&nbsp;Huma Abedin’s romance with Bradley Cooper comes after the latter’s breakup with Glee actress Dianna Agron.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiZq5mUobK6ecKopqmdomK2tHnRrqSoqpWZerW7jJucZpyRqbavs4yhrKaZXZavprDIp2Y%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./bella-hadid-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-208368-html.html><span>←</span><span>Bella Hadid Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</span></a>
