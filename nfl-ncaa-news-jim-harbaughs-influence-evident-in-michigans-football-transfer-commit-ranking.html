Surely, the forthcoming Rose Bowl has its effects, but it’s the future that has the organization in knots. The chances of Jim Harbaugh’s switch are increasing by the day. Hence, the circumstances propel the organization further to make the best recruits for the next season.</p><p>The Wolverines are already down by three, as Leon Franklin, Sam Staruch, and second-year scholarship running back CJ Stokes made their choice of entering the transfer portal. Not to mention, the Wolverines losing on crucial players like McCarthy, Corum, and Zinter given their choice to shift to the NFL next season. Amidst all of this, the Wolverines secured their beacon of hope, a new commit.</p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9>The Michigan Wolverines welcome Jaishawn Barham</h2><p>Although transfer portals have been the forte of Michigan for the last few years, given the addition of Olu Oluwatimi, Drake Nugent, Josaiah Stewart, and AJ Barn, the previous season left its mark, with a third consecutive Big Ten championship win. Wednesday brought similar news for the team, as Jaishawn Braham announced his commitment to Michigan. The former Terrapins’ three-star linebacker has a terrific record throughout his two seasons.</p><p>As if the linebacker’s massive 6-foot-4, 235+ pound physique was not impressive, his almost 100 tackles, seven sacks, an interception, and a pair of pass deflections, all in two years surely is. ESPN ranked the LB ahead of the transfer. While he was not in the top 10, Tom Vareehan thought positively highly of the Terps transfer. “Getting Barham helps add depth, experience, and someone who can help in the pass rush within the linebacking corps for next season and beyond,” wrote the ESPN author.</p><p>Michigan badly needed this transfer given Western Kentucky’s Upton Stout’s <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>withdrawal from the transfer portal,</a> resulting in shattered hope for the Wolverines. With the crushing setback, Michigan awaits Harbaugh’s say in the proposed contract.</p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9>Wolverines bait for Jim Harbaugh: The $125 million contract</h2><p>The contract extension proposed by the officials, although lucrative in nature, comes with a caveat: Harbaugh’s undying commitment to the team for 2024. If Harbaugh accepts the $125 million contract, it will put him on the list of one of the highest-paid coaches in college football.</p><p><strong>Read Also:</strong>&nbsp;<a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Paul Finebaum Sparks Controversy by Calling Mr. Michigan Jim Harbaugh a “Dinosaur” as Chargers Switch Rumors Intensify</a></p><p>However, the reluctance from Harbaugh’s end might hint at his consideration of the offers coming in from the NFL. Given the sign-stealing fiasco and its impending outcomes, “Harbaugh would be wise to make the shift”, per Paul Finebaum. Will he? Harbaugh’s actions would be the answer to the question.</p><p><strong>Watch This Story |</strong>&nbsp;<a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Coach Jim Harbaugh Sets The Record Straight On Michigan’s Sign-Stealing Incident</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pr%2FSnqWtoZGhubq%2Fz6ipratemLyue82fo2amk5aubrrEsKpmopmieqmt0ZuYrp%2BYqHqqusWlrJ6mk5p6psLInZynrF2eu265yJyfop%2BRo8Buss6oq5uZnKF6tb7Ap6qfnaJisLC5zKKrZqqRo7iqusZo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./nba-active-basketball-news-perspective-is-victor-wembanyamas-skinny-physique-already-causing-a-problem-with-his-constant-injuries.html><span>←</span><span>Is Victor Wembanyamas Skinny Physique Already Causing a Problem With HisConstant Injuries?</span></a>
