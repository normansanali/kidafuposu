Here, <a href=#><strong>Us Weekly</strong></a> uncovers five fun facts about the Ohio native who got his start as a hunky male model on reality TV.</p><p><strong>1. </strong>Lanter is more than just a pretty face — though his good looks did earn him his first big break. In 2004, Lanter appeared on the Bravo reality series Manhunt: The Search for America's Most Gorgeous Model. Hosted by <a href=#><strong>Carmen Electra</strong></a>, the series — similar to America's Next Top Model — was won by Jon Jonsson.</p><p><strong>2. </strong>He's a self-professed tech nerd. A huge Star Wars aficionado, Lanter lends his voice to the television series Star Wars: The Clone Wars, as well as its three video games.</p><p><strong>3. </strong>When he's not busy planning his upcoming wedding to fiancee Angela Stacy, he's a total homebody. "[We usually] sit at home and chill and sit in the hot tub or watch The Walking Dead," the actor tells <strong>Us</strong>. "We're kind of homebodies and like to stay home and just enjoy each other, our place and our dog."</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p><strong>4.</strong> Lanter is a sports nut. Once a bat boy for the Atlanta Braves, Lanter played baseball, football and golf before majoring in sports business at the University of Georgia.</p><p><strong>5.</strong> Should 90210 ever get made into a movie, Lanter knows just the actor he wants to portray Liam. "I would aim high, like <a href=#><strong>Leonardo DiCaprio</strong></a> or something," Lanter laughed of the A-lister. "That guy does amazing work! Put it out there — see if he calls back!"</p><p>90210 airs Mondays at 8 p.m. (EST) on The CW.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaGxmrJieu6i%2FjLKmrmWUpLu1ecqnprBlkZe8tsCMcmdraWCoeq6t061kpZmeqbKzeZFpaGtrYWZ9cA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./fix-roomba-side-brush-not-spinning.html><span>←</span><span>Why is my Roomba side brush not spinning?</span></a>
