He made his name as a carpenter on the home improvement show Trading Spaces, which aired on TLC between 2000 and 2003. But it is through his stint as host of ABC's Extreme Makeover: Home Edition that people really came to discover more intimate <a href=#>details of his personal and professional life</a>. He was in that particular job for nine years, before the series originally wrapped up in 2012, after a total of 202 episodes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Pennington is currently married to a social media manager named Kellee Merrell, who he first met in 2020 before popping the big question midway through last year. Previously, the TV personality had been in a long term relationship with <a href=#>his ex-girlfriend, Andrea Bock</a>, with whom he eventually broke up before he met Merrell.</p><p>Pennington has also had to deal with a number of challenges in his life, including an ADHD diagnosis while he was still in elementary school, and a DUI charge that almost saw him spend time in jail in 2007.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>10 Celebs Who Live With ADHD</a></span></p><p>For all these, the 57-year-old has also managed to make enough money to last him multiple lifetimes.

Most of this is attributable to his time as a reality TV star, although he has also ventured into other money-making endeavors.</p><p>With most of this work still ongoing, the TV personality is likely to see his wealth continue growing in the coming years.</p><h2 id=ty-pennington-earned-75-000-per-episode-of-39-extreme-makeover-home-edition-39><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Ty Pennington Earned $75,000 Per Episode Of 'Extreme Makeover: Home Edition'</span></h2><p>The nine years that Pennington spent as the host of Extreme Makeover: Home Edition are undoubtedly the most financially productive of his life.

He is practically an expert now, with knowledge on do's and don'ts of home DIY projects.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=ty-pennington-is-a-two-time-39-primetime-emmy-39-award-winner><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Ty Pennington Is A Two-Time 'Primetime Emmy' Award Winner</span></h2><p>There is no greater honor for a TV personality than to win a Primetime Emmy Award for your work. For three consecutive years between 2005 and 2007, Pennington's Extreme Makeover was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">nominated for Outstanding Reality Program</a>.</p><p>He emerged victorious in the first two of those.
