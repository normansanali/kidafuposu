However, her first recognizable film role was in the Canadian film The Long Weekend in 2005, where she played a character named Ellen. Since then, Smulders has been a part of more than 25 films. Here are the best 5 among them:</p><h2 data-injectable=false>5. Delivery Man (2013)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Cobie-Smulders-in-Delivery-Man.jpg><p data-characters=451 data-current-count=751 data-injectable=true>Smulders was tapped to play the part of Emma in <strong>Delivery Man</strong>, a remake of the 2011 Canadian film, Starbuck. The comedy-drama film centers around David Wozniak, a deliveryman for his family’s butcher shop who gave 693 donations to a sperm bank under the alias “Starbuck'” and fathered 533 children as a result. Wozniak is now stuck in a class action lawsuit by 142 of his children, forcing the fertility clinic to reveal his identity.</p><p data-characters=258 data-current-count=258 data-injectable=false>Smulders plays his girlfriend, Emma, an NYPD officer who is pregnant with his child and decides to raise it by herself. Though the film mostly revolves around Vince Vaughn and Chris Pratt, it’s refreshing to watch her play a sensitive role in a comedy.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>4. Unexpected (2015)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Cobie-Smulders-in-Unexpected-2015.jpg><p data-characters=340 data-current-count=340 data-injectable=false><strong>Unexpected</strong> stars Smulders as a high school teacher in an inner-city Chicago neighborhood.

While coping with their unexpected shared dilemma and bonding over future plans, the two forge an odd relationship.</p><p data-characters=280 data-current-count=620 data-injectable=true>The audience was drawn in by the movie’s provocative topics and the revelation that Smulders was truly pregnant when the 2014 production was underway. The actress excels in a poignant, composed, and sensitive role in the film, in contrast to her recent action-packed flicks.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>3. Jack Reacher: Never Go Back (2016)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Cobie-Smulders-in-Jack-Reacher.jpg><p data-characters=363 data-current-count=663 data-injectable=true>In the 2016 Jack Reacher sequel, Smulders played Major Susan Turner in an action-packed role alongside Tom Cruise. The story revolves around Cruise’s title hero and Smulders’ Major Turner, who is wanted for espionage and on the run as they uncover a sinister conspiracy. Smulders is stunning in the army get-up and maintains authenticity in her role.</p><p data-characters=306 data-current-count=306 data-injectable=false>Even though the plot was not well-received by the critics, Smulders left a lasting impression with her action and she performed all of her stunts in the film. Though she already debuted as Agent Maria Hill in MCU before <strong>Jack Reacher: Never Go Back</strong>, the film realized and fully explored her action capacity.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>2. The Intervention (2016)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Cobie-Smulders-in-The-Intervention-2016.jpg><p data-characters=319 data-current-count=319 data-injectable=false><strong>The Intervention</strong> puts Smulders at the center of the plot with Vincent Piazza as her husband. The film follows a weekend getaway for four couples of old friends that takes a sharp turn when Ruby and Peter (Smulders and Piazza) learn the entire trip was planned to serve as a venue for an intervention in their marriage.</p><p data-characters=419 data-current-count=738 data-injectable=true>Ruby, the patient spouse of the career-driven, workaholic businessman Peter, is portrayed by Smulders. It is a lighthearted take on issues in married life that at times reads as sorrowful and relatable. The star broke her leg the day before filming while playing with her children, but director Clea DuVall decided to include it in the narrative rather than replace her or use camera angles that would cover the injury.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>1. Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Cobie-Smulders-in-Age-of-Ultron.jpg><p data-characters=289 data-current-count=589 data-injectable=true>Smulders began her Marvel Cinematic Universe journey in 2012 with The Avengers before starring in its follow-up, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Avengers: Age of Ultron</strong>.</a> In the movie, the Avengers battle the titular villain, an artificial intelligence that wants to wipe out humanity in order to bring about world peace.</p><p data-characters=473 data-current-count=473 data-injectable=true>Smulders reprises the role of Maria Hill, a former high-ranking S.H.I.E.L.D. agent who now works for Tony Stark. She is a sophisticated and tenacious character who ensures that operations at the Avengers’ headquarters operate as smoothly as possible. The film was well-received and gave Hill more room to grow within the MCU. Avengers: Infinity War (2018) and Avengers: Endgame (2019) came out as sequels to Age of Ultron, owing to the film’s worldwide success.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>TV Shows</h2><p data-characters=249 data-current-count=249 data-injectable=false>Smulders started her career in television before she took on movies.
