At the same time that Jessica is resigning herself to her heartbreaking love life, the owner of a gorgeous gallery moves in across the street. She resolves not to date during the holiday season.</p><p>Now that the holiday season has officially begun, crack up a Christmas Lucky Charm and celebrate with your family as you chose which cookies to set out for Santa this year. The following is an exhaustive list of all the information that we currently possess concerning the movie’s cast.</p><img data-lazyloaded=1 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/theancestory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Christmas-Lucky-Charm-will-premiere-on-UPtv-300x162.png decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-89319 alt="Christmas Lucky Charm will premiere on UPtv" width=600 height=324 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-89319 class=wp-caption-text>Christmas Lucky Charm will premiere on UPtv</p><h2 id=christmas-lucky-charm-cast><span id=Christmas_Lucky_Charm_Cast>Christmas Lucky Charm Cast</span></h2><h3><span id=Sugenja_Sri_As_Jessica_Connolly><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Sugenja Sri As Jessica Connolly</span></span></h3><img data-lazyloaded=1 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/theancestory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Sugenja-Sri-plays-Jessica-Connolly-in-Christmas-Lucky-Charm-300x271.png decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-89320 alt="Sugenja Sri plays Jessica Connolly in Christmas Lucky Charm" width=505 height=456 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-89320 class=wp-caption-text>Sugenja Sri plays Jessica Connolly in Christmas Lucky Charm</p><p>The movie stars Sri as Jessica Connolly, who is played by the character she portrayed. She is considered to be one of the film’s main actresses. Some of Sugenja Sri’s most well-known works are the television shows Designated Survivor (2018), A Simple Favor (2018), and The Handmaid’s Tale (2017).</p><p>Sienna is the role that she plays in the Hulu adaptation of “The Handmaid’s Tale.” In this television series, the handmaid known as June gets renamed Offred at some point. The majority of the United States is currently under the control of a theocratic religious regime, which has led to the rebranding of the country as Gilead.</p><p>In this country, women are considered to be no more than second-class citizens. Anyone who makes an attempt to get away will be found and punished. One such person is known as June; she is caught while attempting to flee from her husband and kid, and as a result, she is sentenced to the role of a handmaid, in which she is responsible for bearing children for political leaders who do not have children of their own.</p><p>We attempted to find Jessica on social media, but it appears that she does not participate there. We are looking forward to interacting with her on one of the several social media platforms in the near future so that we can get to know her better.</p><p><strong>Also read:&nbsp;A Look Into Vanna White Weight Loss Journey, How Much Lbs Did She Lose?</strong></p><h3><span id=Adrian_Spencer_As_Mitch_Jameson><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Adrian Spencer As Mitch Jameson</span></span></h3><p>Adrian Spencer portrays the role of Mitch Jameson in the movie.
