Like many American women, Anna has postponed her dreams of motherhood to focus on her career, and now that she’s ready, both goals seem at odds with each other. After years of plugging away on a low-budget CW network series, Anna’s recent role in the indie horror flick “The Auteur” proved an unexpected breakout success. This puts her on the path to an Oscar just as she’s beginning her third round of fertility treatment.</p><p dir=ltr>Although it would seem like Anna is finally in control of her own life and body,&nbsp;her publicist and best friend Siobhan (Kim Kardashian) keeps pushing&nbsp;sketchy vitamin shots at her, while Anna’s husband&nbsp;(Matt Czuchry) and fertility doctor&nbsp;(Denis O’Hare) continue to talk across her. Even her own body seems at odds with her mind as Anna grapples with lost time, apparent hallucinations, and debilitating versions of the usual pregnancy symptoms like nausea and pain.</p><p dir=ltr>Despite a distressing miscarriage of one of her embryos and Anna’s belief that a stalker is trying to stop her pregnancy, her Oscar run and gestation race ahead. By the time she’s in her second trimester, the slew of psychological horrors plaguing Anna includes visions of a Satanic coven in the basement, cravings for raccoon carrion, and worst of all, the passive-aggressive gratitude of her Gen Z Oscar competition.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue9OrnKecmaO0cMDHnmSeppSeu6h5zp9kmqWVp7akrc1mn6iqoqS%2Fbr%2FTqKmyZZSauaqvwK2cZqiRp8FufYyer6mkkZ67prCO</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-early-signs-are-there-netflix-users-are-making-good-on-their-promise-to-ignore-the-witcher.html><span>←</span><span>The early signs are there Netflix users are making good on their promise to ignore The Witcher</span></a>
