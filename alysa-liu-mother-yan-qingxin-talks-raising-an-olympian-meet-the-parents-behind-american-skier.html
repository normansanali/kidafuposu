However, she is not the biological mother of Alysa Liu.</p><p>According to The Focus News, Alysa and her siblings were produced through in vitro fertilization and delivered through surrogate mothers. Both of Liu’s donors were white women in the hopes that they would “benefit from a diversified gene pool.”</p><p>Yan Qingxin is also known as Mary and was married to Alysa’s father, Arthur Liu when she was born. Unfortunately, the couple is divorced, but the Liu children refer to her as mom and spend time with her regularly.</p><p>Arthur took his daughter to the ice when she was five years old, inspired by the successes of two-time Olympic figure skater Michelle Kwan. He’s known as the “full-fledged skating parent” and makes a checklist for his daughter before each practice.</p><p>Alysa presented her gold medal to her father when she won a competition in 2019.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=alysa-liu-age-how-old-is-the-olympian></span>Alysa Liu Age: How Old Is The Olympian?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Alysa Liu, the young talented figure skater, is 16 years of age.

The young figure skater has beautiful black-colored eyes with brown hair, which fits her bold yet confident persona.</p><p>She often shares photographs of her travels, competitions, friends, and family with her 51.9k followers on&nbsp;Instagram.</p><p>Alysa became the youngest figure skater in U.S. history to land three triple axels in a single competition and win back-to-back titles in 2019 and 2020 at thirteen years old.</p><p>Those achievements have earned her the moniker “Simone Biles of figure skating,” among others. Alysa credits her success as a world-renowned skater to the assistance of her father, siblings, and family.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=yan-qingxin-family-details-how-many-daughters-does-she-have></span>Yan Qingxin Family Details: How Many Daughters Does She Have?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Yan Qingxin, the mother of Alysa Liu, has two other daughters named Selina and Julia.

However, as mentioned above, Yan is not the biological mother of the Liu children.</p><p>Sports Illustrated stated that Arthur Liu had his children through in vitro fertilization, or IVF, using two distinct egg donors and two different surrogates.</p><p>According to the magazine, Mr. Liu desired a large family similar to his own in China and began looking for an egg donor. For almost three years, the family lived in a cramped one-bedroom apartment because of the high cost of the process.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaJmcrsCiecuirGaln6m1pr6MspinZaGeu6jEyKdkrZmcoMBuvsCiqqKml2Kur3nOpbCmqJmWu265xJ6rZqyYmnqxrdGepa2rXZeyqbXNnWSapZWntqStzWaqpKGVp3w%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./10-hallmark-winterfest-movies-to-enjoy-post-countdown-to-christmas.html><span>←</span><span>10 Hallmark Winterfest Movies to Enjoy Post-Countdown to Christmas</span></a>
