Bridgers, like any other ordinary person who binged Normal People during the lockdown, rushed to Twitter to express her love for the show. “Finished normal people and now I’m depressed and horny oh wait,” the singer wrote. Mescal answered, “I’m officially dead,” after firing his shot. We are as well. But wait, there’s more. Bridgers responded flirtatiously, “nooo don’t die, you’re so great aha.” We enjoy seeing it.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>I'm officially dead.</p><p>— Paul Mescal (@mescal_paul) <a href=# rel=noopener>May 12, 2020</a></p><h3>PAUL AND PHOEBE HOST AN INSTAGRAM LIVE TOGETHER IN MAY 2020.</h3><p>Mescal and Bridgers electronically met for the first time in front of the account’s 1 million followers while hosting an Instagram live for Wonderland Magazine.

Bridgers, who lives in Los Angeles, came to Ireland to meet with the actor. We like bringing a long-distance partnership together.<br>Although the couple attempted to keep this a secret, the restaurant (where the pair dined for breakfast) took it upon itself to spread the word. The Lemon Tree Cafe revealed the couple in a tweet by stating “Thank you for stopping by our café for breakfast this morning, @mescal paul and @phoebe bridgers. Such fantastic young talent #Celebrities #musicaltalent #Staycation2020 #breakfast #voiceofageneration “. It’s all about the hashtags for us.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Fan- Tas- Tic day thanks to <a href=# rel=noopener>@mescal_paul</a> and <a href=# rel=noopener>@phoebe_bridgers</a> for calling to our café this morning for breakfast.

Having someone to lean on in such a crazy, crazy time has been wonderful. I honestly don’t know where I’d be without her.”</p><h3>PAUL APPEARS IN PHOEBE’S MUSIC VIDEO “SAVIOR COMPLEX” IN DECEMBER 2020.</h3><p>This cinematic noir classic, directed by Fleabag actress Phoebe Waller-Bridge, stars Bridgers and Mescal against each other for the music video for Bridgers’ “Savior Complex.” The music video stars a disheveled (yet swoon-worthy) Mescal as a con artist, accompanied by a gorgeous of puppy named Charlotte.<br>Mescal posted a lovely behind-the-scenes photo on Instagram, “I’m sure there is a joke somewhere about this actually being the two most powerful Phoebes in the world, but I’m not witty enough to find it.”</p><h3>THE PAIR WAS SEEN AT A HALLOWEEN PARTY IN OCTOBER 2021.</h3><p>During the Halloween season, the couple was photographed at a Halloween party on a friend’s Instagram. What about their pair of costumes? Megan Fox and Machine Gun Kelly, complete with stick-on tattoos, a black wig, and a faux-Mugler outfit. Iconic.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecurrent-online.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Phoebe-Bridgers-Dating-Paul-Mescal-scaled.webp alt="Phoebe Bridgers Dating Paul Mescal" width=2560 height=1707 sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h3>PAUL ATTENDS GUCCI’S LOVE PARADE FASHION SHOW IN NOVEMBER 2021.</h3><p>Gucci hired Bridgers to model in their celebrated Spring/Summer 2022 fashion show ‘Love Parade’ on Hollywood Boulevard.

Both dressed to the nines in Gucci for the LACMA Art + Film Gala, the duo passionately hug and giggle as Mescal drapes an arm around Bridgers’ waist. Goals.</p><h3>PHOEBE SUBTLY REFERENCES THE RELATIONSHIP ON TWITTER IN NOVEMBER 2021</h3><p>Bridgers disclosed an interesting tidbit about Mescal in a tweet that went viral.<br>“Paul thinks Thousand Island is called Hundred Years Sauce,” the social media post said. To be honest, we don’t blame him.<br>While we file this bit of knowledge under “things we didn’t need to know but are glad we do,” we enjoy the public shaming.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>paul thinks thousand island is called hundred years sauce</p><p>— traitor joe (@phoebe_bridgers) <a href=# rel=noopener>November 7, 2021</a></p><h3>PAUL AND PHOEBE GO OFFICIAL ON INSTAGRAM IN DECEMBER 2021</h3><p>Bridgers makes their romance public on Instagram, posting a super-sweet selfie of the couple on a pier. Mescal is tenderly pressing his face into hers in the photo, and we can’t help but hope he would do the same to us. The photograph’s best feature? They were wearing matching black hoodies. Bridgers paired hers with a leather jacket in typical SoCal fashion, while Mescal went for a classic British windbreaker.</p><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100% rel=noopener>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none rel=noopener>A post shared by Phoebe Bridgers (@phoebebridgers)</a></p><h3>THE MET GALA IN MAY 2022</h3><p>Paul and Phoebe attend the Met Gala together just days after she supposedly announced him to her Coachella audience as her fiancée. Nobody gave it any mind until he was seen sporting a ring on his engagement finger. Is this to say Phoebe proposed and Paul accepted?! We don’t know because neither of them has commented on it since…talk about a cliffhanger.</p><h3>ANOTHER MUSIC VIDEO CAMEO IN JUNE 2022</h3><p>The actor made a brief appearance in Bridgers’ Sidelines music video, which featured a compilation of behind-the-scenes footage from her live performances. Cute.</p><p>The pair are now looking to buy a home in Paul’s native Ireland, specifically Schull in West Cork, according to the Irish Examiner. They’ll also have some good neighbors, as actress Saoirse Ronan owns property in the vicinity.</p><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6oU7ipY99M</p><h2>FAQs</h2><h3>What brought Paul Mescal and Phoebe together?</h3><p>According to Phoebe, the couple first met in person when Paul suggested they collaborate on something.
