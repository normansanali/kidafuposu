When Stone was announced as the winner of the Best Actress category for her role as Bella Baxter in Poor Things, the star appeared confused and made her way up to the stage in a state of shock while also pointing to the back of her dress, which had <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>popped open during Ryan Gosling's "I'm Just Ken" performance</a> (as one's top does when 70 hot Kens are dancing on stage).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Throughout the speech, Stone spoke with disbelief, acknowledged her hoarse voice, and thanked her husband, Dave McCary. Stone then went on to give an adorable shoutout to the couple's soon-to-be 3-year-old daughter.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"And, most importantly,&nbsp;my daughter, who's going to be three&nbsp;in three days and has turned our lives technicolor," she said while choking back tears before reciting lyrics from pal Taylor Swift's song "Bigger Than the Whole Sky." "I&nbsp;love you bigger than the whole sky, my girl."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Stone and Swift's friendship goes all the way back to 2008 when the duo first met at the Young Hollywood Awards. They've been pals ever since, supporting each other in different endeavors along the way. Stone even recently <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>attended </a><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>The Eras Tour</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I've known her since we were 17 and 18, so she hooked me up, which was very nice 'cause I know those tickets are impossible to get,” she told&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Vanity Fair</a>&nbsp;about attending Swift's show. "She's a wonderful friend. She blows my mind."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Earlier this awards season, Stone and Swift both attended the Golden Globes for respective projects (Stone for Poor Things and Swift for the Swift: The Eras Tour movie). When Stone received the trophy for Best Performance by a Female Actor in a Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy, Swift cheered from the audience. During an interview after the win, Stone was asked about Swift's reaction, to which Stone hilariously replied, "What an asshole. I've known her for almost 20 years. I was very happy she was there, and she was also nominated tonight, which was wonderful. And yes, what an asshole."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">After her quotes went viral, Stone <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>vowed to never joke about her friend again</a> because the media used her teasing words "out of context."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I definitely won’t make a joke like that again… because I saw headlines that really pulled it out of context,”&nbsp;she told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Variety</a> before pointing to herself and saying, "What a dope."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57xKakmmWjqbyvsYytmLKkn6d6tMPIn6tmpKmntqR5w5qsoKCkmr9ufo9ra2ano5ius7%2BMrKeenZOdenmCj3Bpamk%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./does-coolant-have-to-be-the-same-color.html><span>←</span><span>Does coolant have to be the same color?</span></a>
