Morgan Yoney underwent a second double-lung transplant at UPMC-Presbyterian Hospital in Pittsburgh after waiting over two years for a donor.
Despite having a successful initial lung transplant at age 15, her battle with cystic fibrosis left her frail and in need of a double lung transplant.
Unfortunately, the symptoms of the disease took a toll on her transplanted lungs."><meta name=author content="Reinaldo Massengill"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
