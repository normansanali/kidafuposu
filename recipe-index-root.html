If you like, you can add a dash of hot sauce or a pinch of paprika to kick the flavors up a notch. But without them, your deviled eggs will still be delicious. Because classic deviled eggs are so tasty AND so simple, they’re a perfect appetizer for Easter, the holidays, parties…any occasion, really.

You’re going to buy a&nbsp;whole entire cabbage in order to add a&nbsp;tiny bit of it&nbsp;to some tacos? What on earth are you going to do with the rest?! My hope is that the cabbage recipes below offer an answer to that question. There are SO MANY ways to cook cabbage—this humble veggie is nothing if not versatile. It can complete a sandwich with a pop of color and crunch. It can transform into a crisp, refreshing slaw or a silky, sweet sauté. You can add it to soup or…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>These carrot cake cupcakes are the fun-size version of my favorite spring dessert: carrot cake! I love to bring them to parties and gatherings because they’re easy to make, perfect for sharing, and sooo delicious. Just like a great slice of carrot cake, these carrot cupcakes are soft, moist, warmly spiced, and packed with fresh carrots. Rich, tangy cream cheese frosting takes them over the top. Carrot Cake Cupcakes Ingredients Here’s what you’ll need to make this carrot cake cupcake recipe: Carrots, of course! They add moisture and sweet, earthy flavor to these scrumptious cupcakes.

This sweet, tangy topping is the perfect complement to just about any cake or cupcake, not to mention cookies, bars, and quick breads. I have it on repeat around here in the spring, when we have carrot cake cupcakes for Easter, an actual carrot cake for Jack’s birthday, and then carrot cake cookies, well, just because I like them. 🙂 My cream cheese frosting recipe calls for 4 basic ingredients, and it comes together in less than 10 minutes. The next time you want to make a homemade baked good taste extra-decadent and special,…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>A breakfast casserole is the best way to feed a crowd first thing in the morning. Just ask my mom! She’s been making her famous breakfast casserole recipe on Easter and Christmas morning for as long as I can remember. The rest of my family loves it because it’s hearty and flavorful, packed with potatoes, veggies, eggs, and cheese. My mom loves it because it’s easy to make and—even better—make ahead.&nbsp;She can prep the whole thing the night before and pop it in the oven when guests arrive the next day. I adapted this breakfast casserole recipe from hers, and…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Chewy, nutty, and incredibly easy to cook, bulgur wheat is good for so much more than tabbouleh! This whole grain will always have a place in my pantry. In case you’re curious about adding it to yours, I’m sharing a full guide to bulgur below. Learn what it is, how to cook it, how to store it, and more! Bulgur vs. Cracked Wheat Bulgur is a type of cracked wheat…but not all cracked wheat is bulgur. The difference is that bulgur is&nbsp;par-boiled, or partially cooked, in the production process. As a result, it has a much shorter cooking time than…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Fingers crossed you have a couple ripe bananas on your counter right now, because these banana pancakes are the perfect weekend breakfast! They’re fluffy, moist, and tender, with a warm, spiced banana flavor that will keep you coming back for more. They’re also conveniently easy to make, so if you’ve just rolled out of bed and have yet to drink your morning coffee, you won’t have any trouble whipping them up. Pass the maple syrup, and enjoy! We love this banana pancake recipe, and I think you will too.

They make this soup supremely quick and easy. It’s just the thing for nights when you’re really craving the comfort and convenience of takeout, but you somehow convince yourself to cook dinner anyway. And if you cook this dumpling soup, you’ll be glad you did! The potstickers and veggies float in a fragrant broth that’s spiked with garlic, tamari, and lots of fresh ginger. It’s warming and flavorful, and the fact that it comes together in under 30 minutes only makes it taste better. This dumpling soup has been one…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>This mushroom pasta recipe is a mushroom lover’s dream. It’s bursting with meaty sautéed mushrooms. Along with a splash of white wine and Parmesan cheese, they pack this pasta with rich, umami flavor. I don’t use heavy cream in this recipe, but it’s still lightly creamy. Starchy pasta water and a pat of butter bring the mushrooms together into a silky sauce that coats the pasta. It’s savory, delicious, and all about the mushrooms. If you’re a mushroom fan, you have to try it! What You’ll Need for Mushroom Pasta The star ingredient in this mushroom pasta recipe is—of course—mushrooms!…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>These vegan enchiladas are seriously delicious. Whenever I make them, my husband Jack and I fight over the last one. For context, Jack might be the world’s biggest cheese lover. If he’s going after cheese-less enchiladas, you know they have to be good. The filling here is a hearty mixture of mushrooms, peppers, and black beans. I roll it up in corn tortillas and then smother them with red enchilada sauce and homemade vegan nacho cheese. Before serving, I sprinkle garnishes like jalapeños, radishes, and avocado on top. This vegan enchiladas recipe is comforting, but also fresh. The rich enchilada…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>This banana bread recipe is the best way to use overripe bananas. Now that we have a little one in the house, we’ve been buying a LOT more bananas than we used to. Sometimes (ok, often), we don’t get to all of them before they ripen, and I end up with a heap of dark brown, spotty bananas on my counter. Banana bread to the rescue! But not just any banana bread. While some popular recipes call for 2 or 3 bananas, this banana bread recipe calls for 4.
