"I want to thank their mom Olivia, who had the initial idea to do this as a TV show, saying, 'You and Brendan [Hunt] and Joe [Kelly] like doing that so much, you should do it as a movie or TV show' ... She was right."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Wilde responded on Twitter, adding a joke about the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>now-viral hoodie he wore to the Golden Globes</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Congrats to Jason and the entire Ted Lasso family on your @CriticsChoice wins!" she <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>wrote</a>.
