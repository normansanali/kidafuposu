"[I] would never hit my wife," he added. (Cage and Williams, 22, were both booked on felony domestic violence charges on Sunday after she allegedly went after him with a bottle.) "Why would I start abusing after she was positive after taking a pregnancy test?"</p><p>The Eyes of Noctum band member added cryptically: "Have fun killing my child, Breyan Prescott."</p><p>Last month a restraining order was issued against Cage when he physically attacked Kevin Villegas, Nicolas Cage's assistant who claims he was hired to locate Weston. After a stint in rehab, he challenged Villegas to a fight and vowed to be Williams' "bodyguard".</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Despite claiming to still love his wife of two months, Cage addressed the tumultuous nature of their relationship. "I don't know if being in your husband is in the stars anymore for me," he admitted.</p><p>At the time of their nuptials, Weston optimistically told <a href=#>Us Weekly</a>: " I want our love to set an example to others and my dad."</p><p>In April, Nicolas Cage, 47, was arrested for domestic abuse, public drunkenness and disturbing the peace following a loud fight with wife Alice Kim. The charges were dropped and Kim insisted there was no physical contact. Cage married Kim (then a cocktail waitress) in 2004; they have a 5-year-old son, Kal-El. Prior to Kim, he was married to <strong>Patricia Arquette</strong> from 1995 to 2001 and to<strong> Lisa Marie Presley</strong> from 2002 to 2004.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGawnaOpvK95wpqenmWdrnq4tcWeZKKrXaW%2FprPNmqWtZZlixKK602aYZpyZq7yzr8RmaWlpYWuEcA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-walking-dead-who-is-dead-and-who-is-alive-in-the-final-season.html><span>←</span><span>The Walking Dead: Who is Dead and Who is Alive in the Final Season</span></a>
