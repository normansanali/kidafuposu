Yet, it was enough time to create one of the most memorable depictions of the dictator in recent years.</p>Martin Wuttke’s notorious rant scene.<p>The emphasis on Hitler’s infamous temper borders on satire just enough to avoid becoming slapstick.</p><p>Wuttke’s performance is thus one of the few recent portrayals of the dictator that clearly doesn’t care about humanizing him.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKHBqa3TrKCnrJWnsrTAyKeeZ5ufonyptdOlnKtlnaTDqrHSaGs%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-are-zack-snyder-kids.html><span>←</span><span>Who Are Zack Snyder's Kids?
