Tolle is described as one of the spiritually most influential persons in the world. His career started in 1997.</p><p>Have you ever wondered how rich Eckhart Tolle is, as of mid-2016? According to authoritative sources, it has been estimated that Eckhart Tolle’s net worth is as high as $15 million, earned through his successful writing career. In addition to having his books sell millions of copies, Tolle has also released DVD’s and worked as a counsellor and spiritual teacher, which have improved his wealth.</p><h3>Eckhart Tolle Net Worth $15 Million</h3><p>Eckhart Tolle spent the first 13 years of his life in a small town located north of Dortmund in the Ruhr Valley, where he experienced a terrible childhood in a devastated post-war Germany. His parent fought frequently and eventually divorced, so he left to live in Spain with his father at the age of 13. Tolle’s dad didn’t insist on sending him to high school, so Tolle opted to stay at home and learn more about literature, astronomy, and various languages, and moved to London with his father to study German and Spanish at a London school for language studies. Tolle was influenced early in life by the work of Joseph Anton Schneiderfranken, the German mystic. He struggled with depression in his teenage years and tried to find a meaning to his life at the University of London where he studied philosophy, psychology, and literature. Tolle graduated in 1977, and received a scholarship to continue his education at the Cambridge University, but soon dropped out.</p><p>When he was 29-year-old, Tolle experienced an “inner transformation” after suffering from depression for over ten years. He explained it as an amazing peaceful sensation that reshaped his life and allowed him to see the world with different eyes. He spent most of his time just sitting on benches in Central London, but also stayed with friends in a Buddhist monastery. Although his family thought that he was crazy and irresponsible, Tolle changed his first name from Ulrich to Eckhart, in homage to the German mystic and philosopher, Meister Eckhart.</p><p>After working as a spiritual leader and consultant, Tolle started writing his first book, and in 1977 “The Power of Now” was published. Despite the slow start and sales of only 3,000 of the first edition, the republishing of the book in 1999 was a huge hit and even <a href=#>Oprah Winfrey</a> recommended it in her magazine, “O” in 2000; the book has sold over three million copies to date, which has increased his net worth by a large margin.</p><p>In 2001, Tolle released his second book called “Practicing the Power of Now: Essential Teachings, Meditations, and Exercises from The Power of Now”, and later “Stillness Speaks: Whispers of Now” in 2003. His best-selling book came out in 2005, under the name “A New Earth: Awakening to Your Life’s Purpose” and reached over five million copies sold in North America alone, and helped significantly to increase his net worth.</p><p>Tolle has released three more books: “Milton’s Secret: An Adventure of Discovery through Then, When, and The Power of Now” in 2008, “Oneness With All Life: Inspirational Selections from A New Earth” in 2008, and “Guardians of Being” in 2009, a picture book illustrated by Patrick McDonnell.</p><p>In addition to his books, Tolle has also released five DVD’s: “The Flowering of Human Consciousness: Everyone’s Life Purpose” (2001), “Practicing Presence: A Guide for the Spiritual Teacher and Health Practitioner” (2003), “Eckhart Tolle’s Findhorn Retreat: Stillness Amidst The World” (2006), “Finding Your Life’s Purpose” (2008), and “The Doorway into Now” (2009), all of which have added to his net worth.</p><p>Regarding his personal life, Eckhart Tolle started dating Kim Eng in 1995, and they later married, but they don’t have children thus far. They have now lived in Vancouver, British Columbia since 1995.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table class=interesting_facts readability=6.5><tr><th>#</th><th>Fact</th></tr><tr readability=2><td>1</td><td>His book "The Power Of Now" has sold over three million copies.</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>2</td><td>Lives in Vancouver, Canada.</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>3</td><td>His father did not force him to go to school and Eckhart often studied topics such as Astronomy, Literature and Language at home.</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>4</td><td>Was a language teacher in London for three years.</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>5</td><td>Began his spiritual quest at the age of 29 after a bout of suicidal depression.</td></tr></table><h3 class=toggle-head>Writer <span class="fa fa-angle-down" aria-hidden=true></span></h3><table class=writer><tr><th>Title</th><th>Year</th><th>Status</th><th>Character</th></tr><tr><td>Milton's Secret</td><td>2016</td><td>book</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Voguerra</td><td>2016</td><td>Documentary short quotes</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>The Voice in the Head</td><td>2015</td><td>Short a story by</td><td></td></tr></table><h3 class=toggle-head>Producer <span class="fa fa-angle-down" aria-hidden=true></span></h3><table class=producer readability=2><tr><th>Title</th><th>Year</th><th>Status</th><th>Character</th></tr><tr readability=4><td>The Deepest Truth of Human Existence</td><td>2002</td><td>Video documentary producer - uncredited</td><td></td></tr></table><h3 class=toggle-head>Thanks <span class="fa fa-angle-down" aria-hidden=true></span></h3><table class=thanks readability=1><tr><th>Title</th><th>Year</th><th>Status</th><th>Character</th></tr><tr readability=2><td>The Louise Log</td><td>2008</td><td>TV Series very special thanks - 1 episode</td><td></td></tr></table><h3 class=toggle-head>Self <span class="fa fa-angle-down" aria-hidden=true></span></h3><table class=self readability=4><tr><th>Title</th><th>Year</th><th>Status</th><th>Character</th></tr><tr><td>One Life No Regrets</td><td>2017</td><td>Documentary</td><td>Himself</td></tr><tr><td>The Power of the Heart</td><td>2014</td><td>Documentary</td><td>Himself</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Oprah & Eckhart Tolle: A New Earth</td><td>2014</td><td>TV Mini-Series</td><td>Himself - Host</td></tr><tr><td>Stroumboulopoulos</td><td>2013</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Himself</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>One Giant Leap 2: What About Me?</td><td>2008</td><td>Video documentary</td><td>Himself</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Living Luminaries: On the Serious Business of Happiness</td><td>2007</td><td>Documentary</td><td>Himself</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>The Deepest Truth of Human Existence</td><td>2002</td><td>Video documentary</td><td>Himself - Speaker</td></tr></table><h3>Known for movies</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/networthpost.org/wp-content/themes/net-worth/images/celebrity_net_worth.png><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/movies.networthpost.org/movies/thumbs/1836768_Eckhart-Tolle/1836768_The-Voice-in-the-Head-2015.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/movies.networthpost.org/movies/thumbs/1836768_Eckhart-Tolle/1836768_Living-Luminaries-On-the-Serious-Business-of-Happiness-2007.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/movies.networthpost.org/movies/thumbs/1836768_Eckhart-Tolle/1836768_Miltons-Secret-2016.jpg><br><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlanEsL7Toaeoq6RjvLOzjp6apKCRp8FuwM6lo55lnprBbsPOq6uhZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./do-old-ticket-stubs-have-value.html><span>←</span><span>Do old ticket stubs have value?</span></a>
