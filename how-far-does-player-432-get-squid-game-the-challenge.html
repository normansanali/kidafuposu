The series is a reality show version of the scripted series <a href=#>Squid Game</a> on the streaming platform and it features many of the same playground games designed at a larger scale.</p><p>But how far does player 432 get in Squid Game: The Challenge? He knows people are gunning for his elimination, but he also has plenty of friends in the game right off the bat. It seems to be easy for others to follow 432, even if some players see him as a threat to get out as soon as they have the chance.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">How far does player 432 get on 'Squid Game: The Challenge'?</h2><p>Player 432, whose real name is Bryton, is unapologetic about who he is and when player 302, Leann, talks to him about his personality, he says that nothing he does is fake. And for a while, it works for him. But in Episode 3, during the Battleship game, player 432 is eliminated. The ship he's in is sunk and he and his teammates are sent home.</p><p>It's a somewhat anticlimactic ending for player 432, especially since it seemed, up until this point, that he might go further than the majority of the players. He even dropped out of college with a semester left in order to play in Squid Game: The Challenge. Say what you will about his personality and him embracing his villain title, but Bryton plays a solid game until he's eliminated and even then, it's through no fault of his own.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Bryton Constantin (@brytonconstantin)</a></p></figure><p>But, judging by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bryton's Instagram</a>, he isn't letting a silly thing by being eliminated on a Netflix reality show deter him from living his best life. He even has a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube channel</a> where he vlogs about traveling, working out, and apparently going back to college. And something tells us we haven't seen the last of him on reality television. Netflix's Perfect Match, anyone?</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">'Squid Game: The Challenge' features a Battleship competition.</h2><p>The Squid Game reality show features some competitions and challenges that the scripted show doesn't have. Like a life-size version of Battleship, in which players on each team have to stand in ships and hope they aren't eliminated by another team. It's another stressful situation and one that involves lots of trust among teammates.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Are the 'Squid Game: The Challenge' competitions different from the scripted series?</h2><p>Some of the games in Squid Game: The Challenge are the same as the ones featured in the original series. Like Red Light, Green Light, the Dalgona Candy competition, and Marbles. But there are also other games mixed in and mini challenges that test the players in sometimes unimaginable ways.</p><p>Like being forced to choose three players to eliminate at the drop of a hat. Or, rather, at the crank of a jack-in-the-box. And then there's the moment early on where two players have the chance to send someone home or help someone in a future competition. There's a lot on the line, $4.56 million to be exact, and the players all feel it.</p><p>Watch Squid Game: The Challenge on Netflix.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnby4ecWaqWacn5rAbrzLmrCeql1pgHN5xp6rZquhqralecaapJ5lpJ2ybq%2FHmqOlnZ6csg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./page.html><span>←</span><span>Olivia Duffin Net Worth, Age, Boyfriend, Family &amp;amp; Biography</span></a>
