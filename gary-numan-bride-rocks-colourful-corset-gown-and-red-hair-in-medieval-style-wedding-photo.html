Far from your average wedding, however, Gary and Gemma chose bold, unconventional wedding outfits that emphasised their personal style. The electropop star wore a bright orange and gold embroidered waistcoat, a matching tangerine silk cravat, a black tailcoat and matching trousers – nothing out of the ordinary so far. Adding his own touch, Gary rocked lace-up knee-high boots and a chunky gold hoop earring.</p><a href=# style=text-decoration:none rel="noopener noreferrer">View post on Instagram</a>&nbsp;<p id=e_smPMq643Q data-wc=57>His wife looked equally as striking in her colourful ballgown wedding dress, which wouldn't look out of place in medieval times. As well as a full A-line skirt with delicate bow embroidery, the dress featured an off-the-shoulder corset bodice that matched Gary's waistcoat with its orange and gold pattern, alongside a matching choker with a pearl drop.&nbsp;</p><p id=eZnTDg5KoaW data-wc=17>Shades of red or gold were popular among wealthy medieval brides, alongside velvet, satin or silk materials.</p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff>WATCH: More celebrity brides who threw out the rulebook with their unconventional wedding dresses</figure><p id=eFCrJaSvWQa data-wc=26>Gemma wore her fiery red hair in an undone updo with strands framing her face, while a large gold tiara secured her flowing veil in place.</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><ul class=relatedContentListClass_ra09n5z><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="John McEnroe's secret Hawaii wedding with famous rockstar who swore off marriage" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/cbad6e5b8bad-john-mcenroe-patty.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="John McEnroe's secret Hawaii wedding with famous rockstar who swore off marriage" class="miniCardLink_m75k0hi hm-link" href=# rel>John McEnroe's secret Hawaii wedding with famous rockstar who swore off marriage</a></h5></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Helen Flanagan reveals emotional reality of moving on from Scott Sinclair split" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/3b0c44042141-helen-flanagan-ntas.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Helen Flanagan reveals emotional reality of moving on from Scott Sinclair split" class="miniCardLink_m75k0hi hm-link" href=# rel>Helen Flanagan reveals emotional reality of moving on from Scott Sinclair split</a></h5></li></ul><p id=es-YFTfTe6_ data-wc=74>Fast forward two decades and Cars singer Gary still seems to be as in love as ever. He gushed in his Instagram tribute: "Today Gemma and I have been married for 26 years (together for a little over 31). It’s a long time, and yet I still miss her if she goes out, even for an hour, I still smile when I see her name written down or hear her voice on the phone.&nbsp;</p><p id=edlfOUWvPvq data-wc=54>"She is everything that I am not, all the things that I was born without. She is so much more than my best friend, she is the only thing that I could not possibly live without. She makes me happy, proud, safe and secure. She keeps my secrets, shares my fears, calms my nerves.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/0fa450dc5f72-gary-gemma-black-outfits.jpg><p id=eysbCXwLPej data-wc=43>"She makes me laugh, every day. She is kind and caring, thoughtful and loving. Fiercely loyal and ferociously protective, the mother to my children who, like me, are so lucky to have her. She is, quite simply, the world my life revolves around.&nbsp;</p><p id=e2-5SPwzs4b data-wc=55>"My only sadness in all this is that each year we are together takes us one year closer to the inevitable day when we are not. So, until that day comes, I will treasure every moment, appreciate everything we have and try to be the man she deserves. Happy Anniversary Wife, I love you xxx."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/6cf161bd5c38-gary-numan-kids.jpg><p id=erK05K0WKcv data-wc=35>During an appearance on Loose Women, Gemma admitted she was a huge fan of Gary as a child, stating: "I had my little dream come true. I wanted to marry him since I was 10."</p><p id=eKZyeMlbO6x data-wc=16>Their laid-back first date took place at a Little Chef where Gemma chose to go makeup-free.</p><p id=eTPd7PNnWcE data-wc=43>While they haven't released many details of their wedding day, Gary told the<a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>&nbsp;Metro</a> that their first dance was to Closer by Nine Inch Nails. He joked: "The 'I want to [expletive] you like an animal' line certainly took my nan by surprise."</p><p id=eEmCKjGYBcRo data-wc=46>Gary and Gemma have since welcomed three children: Raven, 20, Persia, 18 and Echo,16, and the family of five now live in a <a class=hm-link href=#>22-room house</a> in Los Angeles.
