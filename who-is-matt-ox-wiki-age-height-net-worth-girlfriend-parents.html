Wiki Bio</span></h2><p>Matt Ox was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania USA, on 13 December 2004, so under the zodiac sign of Sagittarius and holding American nationality – he is popular for his still youthful career of a rapper, while he is also a YouTuber.</p><h2><span id=Childhood_and_education>Childhood and education</span></h2><p>Matt has spent his entire childhood in the Lawncrest neighborhood in northeast Philadelphia. He prefers not to talk about the early years of his life, as his father committed suicide while Matt was still just a kid – his mother’s name is Laurel but her profession is not known. Matt appears to be an only child, as he hasn’t mentioned having any siblings.</p><p>Matt grew up listening to Eminem, Kendrick Lamar and Marilyn Manson, and promised to himself that he was going to become a popular rapper one day. His uncle often went to a music studio and took Matt with him, which led Matt to start writing his own rap songs when he was around eight years old. By the time he was 11, Matt had already published his first song.</p><p>He is currently attending second grade of high school and is not planning on enrolling at college, but will rather focus on a career of a rapper.</p><h2><span id=Career_of_a_rapper>Career of a rapper</span></h2><p>The first song for which Matt became popular is “Pretty Penny”, released in January 2017. His name was soon easily recognizable on the internet, and he has already collaborated with many rappers, including Swami Mags, Chxpo, and Lil Tracy. He became popular after working with the “Working on Dying” rap group, and is currently managed by Rich F1lthy Ortiz and Terrell Finesse Green. Even though he is still very young, Matt has nevertheless managed to work with some of the most popular rap producers, such as OogieMane and Froza – his “Low Key” song was launched in February 2017 and he released “Michael Myers” and “This N That” after that. Matt is mostly popular thanks to his song “Overwhelming”, as it was listened to more than 10,000 times in the first day of its upload on SoundCloud, and the <a rel=nofollow href=#>song’s video on YouTube</a> has so far been viewed more than 27 million times – it attracted “The New York Times” and “XXL” magazines’ writers, who later wrote about the young rapper.<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographypedia.org///biographypedia.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/matt-ox-1.jpg></p><p>The song helped him sign a contract with Warner Bros. Records in September 2017. In 2018, Matt released several songs including “Tesla” and “Hop Scotch”, and his first full album came out in October 2018, entitled “OX” and featuring several other rappers, including Key! and Valee.
